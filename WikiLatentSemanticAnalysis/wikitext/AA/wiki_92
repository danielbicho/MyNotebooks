R. Martin. He began the first volume of the series, \"A Game of Thrones\", in 1991 and had it published in 1996. Martin, who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy, has published five out of a planned seven volumes. The fifth and most recent volume of the series published in 2011, \"A Dance with Dragons\", took Martin five years to write. He is still writing the sixth novel, \"The Winds of Winter\".\n\n\"A Song of Ice and Fire\" takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to thirty-one by the fifth. Three main stories interweave a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.\n\nMartin's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels \"The Accursed Kings\" by Maurice Druon. \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion, as well as its realism. An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of violence frequently arise.\n\nAs of April 2015, the books have sold more than 60Â million copies worldwide and have been translated into at least 45 languages. The fourth and fifth volumes reached the top of \"The New York Times\" Best Seller lists upon their releases. Among the many derived works are several prequel novellas, a TV series, a comic book adaptation, and several card, board, and video games.\n\n\"A Song of Ice and Fire\" takes place in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel (see backstory), the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty by Aegon I and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, with Aegon Targaryen becoming the first king of the whole of the continent of Westeros, save for the southerly Dorne. At the beginning of \"A Game of Thrones\", 15 peaceful summer years have passed since the rebellion led by Robert Baratheon deposed and killed the last Targaryen king, Aerys II, and proclaimed Robert king of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nThe principal story chronicles the power struggle for the Iron Throne between the great Houses of Westeros following the death of King Robert in \"A Game of Thrones\". Robert's heir apparent, the 13-year old Joffrey, is immediately proclaimed king through the machinations of his mother, Cersei Lannister. When Lord Eddard \"Ned\" Stark, King Robert's \"Hand\" (chief advisor), discovers that Joffrey and his siblings are the product of incest between Cersei and her twin brother Jaime, Eddard is executed for treason. In response, Robert's brothers Stannis and Renly both lay separate claims to the throne. During this period of instability, two of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros attempt to become independent from the Iron Throne: Ned Stark's eldest son Robb is proclaimed King in the North, while Balon Greyjoy desires to recover the sovereignty of his region, the Iron Islands. The so-called 'War of the Five Kings' is in full progress by the middle of the second book, \"A Clash of Kings\".\n\nThe second story takes place in the far north of Westeros, where an 8,000-year-old wall of ice defends the Seven Kingdoms from the Others. The Wall's sentinels, the Sworn Brotherhood of the Night's Watch, also protect the realm from the incursions of the \"Wildlings\" or \"Free Folk\", who are humans living north of the Wall. The Night's Watch story is told primarily through the point of view of Jon Snow, the bastard son of Eddard Stark. Jon follows the footsteps of his uncle Benjen Stark and joins the Watch at a young age, rising quickly through the ranks. In the third volume, \"A Storm of Swords\", the Night's Watch storyline becomes increasingly entangled with the War of the Five Kings.\n\nThe third story follows Daenerys Targaryen, daughter of the last Targaryen king of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Daenerys' story take place on the continent of Essos, which is located directly east of Westeros across the Narrow Sea. Daenerys' storyline is isolated from the others until \"A Dance with Dragons\". On Essos, Daenerys is married off by her elder brother Viserys Targaryen to a powerful warlord but slowly becomes an independent and intelligent ruler in her own right. Her rise to power is aided by the historic birth of three dragons, hatched from eggs given to her as wedding gifts. The three dragons soon become not only a symbol of her bloodline, but devastating weapons of war.\n\nBooks in the \"Ice and Fire\" series are first published in hardcover and are later re-released as paperback editions. In the UK, Harper Voyager publishes special slipcased editions. The series has also been translated into more than 30 languages. All page totals given below are for the US first editions.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin was already a successful fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" book series. Martin had published his first short story in 1971 and his first novel in 1977. By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction. Although his early books were well received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s. He worked principally on the revival of \"The Twilight Zone\" throughout 1986 and on \"Beauty and the Beast\" until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.\n\nWhen Martin was between Hollywood projects in the summer of 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called \"Avalon\". After three chapters, he had a vivid idea of a boy seeing a man's beheading and finding direwolves in the snow, which would eventually become the first non-prologue chapter of \"A Game of Thrones\". Putting \"Avalon\" aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that it was part of a longer story. After a few more chapters, Martin perceived his new book as a fantasy story and started making maps and genealogies. However, the writing of this book was interrupted for a few years when Martin returned to Hollywood to produce his TV series \"Doorways\" that ABC had ordered but ultimately never aired.\n\nIn 1994, Martin gave to his agent, Kirby McCauley, the first 200 pages and a two-page story projection as part of a planned trilogy with the novels \"A Dance with Dragons\" and \"The Winds of Winter\" intended to follow. When Martin had still not reached the novel's end at 1400 manuscript pages, he felt that the series needed to be four and eventually six books long, which he imagined as two linked trilogies of one long story. Martin chose \"A Song of Ice And Fire\" as the overall series title: Martin saw the struggle of the cold Others and the fiery dragons as one possible meaning for \"Ice and Fire\", whereas the word \"song\" had previously appeared in Martin's book titles \"A Song for Lya\" and \"Songs the Dead Men Sing\", stemming from his obsessions with songs. Martin also named Robert Frost's 1920 poem \"Fire and Ice\" and cultural associations such as passion versus betrayal as possible influences for the series' title.\n\nThe revised finished manuscript for \"A Game of Thrones\" was 1088 pages long (without the appendices), with the publication following in August 1996. \"Wheel of Time\" author Robert Jordan had written a short endorsement for the cover that was influential in ensuring the book's and hence series' early success with fantasy readers. \"Blood of the Dragon\", a pre-release sample novella drawn from Daenerys's chapters, went on to win the 1997 Hugo Award for Best Novella.\n\nThe 300 pages removed from the \"A Game of Thrones\" manuscript served as the opening of the second book, entitled \"A Clash of Kings\". It was released in February 1999 in the United States, with a manuscript length (without appendices) of 1184 pages. \"A Clash of Kings\" was the first book of the \"Ice and Fire\" series to make the best-seller lists, reaching 13 on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list in 1999. After the success of the \"The Lord of the Rings\" films, Martin received his first inquiries to the rights of the \"Ice and Fire\" series from various producers and filmmakers.\n\nMartin was several months late turning in the third book, \"A Storm of Swords\". The last chapter he had written was about the \"Red Wedding\", a pivotal scene notable for its violence (see Themes: Violence and death). \"A Storm of Swords\" was 1521 pages in manuscript (without appendices), causing problems for many of Martin's publishers around the world. Bantam Books published \"A Storm of Swords\" in a single volume in the United States in November 2000, whereas some other-language editions were divided into two, three, or even four volumes. \"A Storm of Swords\" debuted at number 12 in the \"New York Times\" bestseller list.\n\nAfter \"A Game of Thrones\", \"A Clash of Kings\", and \"A Storm of Swords\", Martin originally intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled \"A Dance with Dragons\", was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after \"A Storm of Swords\" so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than \"A Storm of Swords\", Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to \"A Clash of Kings\". A long prologue was to establish what had happened in the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.\n\nIn 2001, Martin was still optimistic that the fourth installment might be released in the last quarter of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called \"A Feast for Crows\". The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.\n\nThe manuscript length of \"A Feast For Crows\" eventually surpassed \"A Storm of Swords\". Martin was reluctant to make the necessary deep cuts to get the book down to publishable length, as that would have compromised the story he had in mind. Printing the book in \"microtype on onion skin paper and giving each reader a magnifying glass\" was also not an option for him. On the other hand, Martin rejected the publishers' idea of splitting the narrative chronologically into \"A Feast for Crows\", Parts One and Two. Being already late with the book, Martin had not even started writing all characters' stories and also objected to ending the first book without any resolution for its many viewpoint characters as in previous books.\n\nWith the characters spread out across the world, a friend suggested that Martin divide the story geographically into two volumes, of which \"A Feast for Crows\" would be the first. This approach would give Martin the room to complete his commenced story arcs as he had originally intended, which he still felt was the best approach years later. Martin moved the unfinished characters' stories set in the east (Essos) and north (Winterfell and the Wall) into the next book, \"A Dance with Dragons\", and left \"A Feast for Crows\" to cover the events on Westeros, King's Landing, the Riverlands, Dorne, and the Iron Islands. Both books begin immediately after the end of \"A Storm of Swords\", running in parallel instead of sequentially, and involve different casts of characters with only little overlap. Martin split Arya's chapters into both books after having already moved the three other most popular characters (Jon Snow, Tyrion, and Daenerys) into \"A Dance with Dragons\".\n\nUpon its release in October 2005 in the UK and November 2005 in the US, \"A Feast for Crows\" went straight to the top of the \"New York Times\" bestseller list. Among the positive reviewers was Lev Grossman of \"Time\", who dubbed Martin \"the American Tolkien\". However, fans and critics alike were disappointed with the story split that left the fates of several popular characters unresolved after \"A Storm of Swords\" cliffhanger ending. With \"A Dance with Dragons\" said to be half-finished, Martin mentioned in the epilogue of \"A Feast for Crows\" that the next volume would be released by the next year. However, planned release dates were repeatedly pushed back. Meanwhile, HBO acquired the rights to turn \"Ice and Fire\" into a dramatic series in 2007 and aired the first of ten episodes covering \"A Game of Thrones\" in April 2011.\n\nWith around 1600 pages in manuscript length, \"A Dance with Dragons\" was eventually published in July 2011 after six years of writing, longer in page count and writing time than any of the preceding four novels. The story of \"A Dance with Dragons\" catches up and goes beyond \"A Feast for Crows\" around two-thirds into the book, but nevertheless covers less story than Martin had intended, omitting at least one planned large battle sequence and leaving several character threads ending in cliff-hangers. Martin attributed the delay mainly to his untangling \"the Meereenese knot\", which the interviewer understood as \"making the chronology and characters mesh up as various threads converged on [Daenerys]\". Martin also acknowledged spending too much time on rewriting and perfecting the story, but soundly rejected the theories of his more extravagant critics that he had lost interest in the series or would bide his time to make more money.\n\nMartin believes the last two volumes of the series will be big books of 1500 manuscript pages each. The sixth book will be called \"The Winds of Winter\", taking the title of the last book of the originally planned trilogy. Displeased with the provisional title \"A Time for Wolves\" for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced \"A Dream of Spring\" as the title for the seventh book in 2006. Martin said in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear in the book.\n\n\"The Winds of Winter\" will resolve the \"Dance with Dragons\" cliffhangers early on and \"will open with the two big battles that [the fifth book] was building up to, the battle in the ice and the battle [...] of Slaver's Bay. And then take it from there.\" By the middle of 2010, Martin had already finished five chapters of \"The Winds of Winter\" from the viewpoints of Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Arianne Martell, and Aeron Greyjoy, accumulating to around 100 completed pages. After the publication of \"A Dance with Dragons\" in 2011, Martin announced he would return to writing in January 2012. He spent the meantime on book tours, conventions, and continued working on his \"The World of Ice & Fire\" companion guide and a new \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" novella.\n\nIn December 2011, Martin posted a chapter from \"The Winds of Winter\" from the viewpoint of Theon Greyjoy; several other chapters have been made public since. Four hundred pages of the sixth novel have been written as of October 2012, although Martin considers only 200 as \"really finished\"; the rest needs revising. In 2011, Martin gave three years as a realistic estimate for finishing the sixth book at a good pace, but said ultimately the book \"will be done when it's done\", acknowledging that his publication estimates had been too optimistic in the past. Martin did not intend to separate the characters geographically again.\n\nIn 2015 there were indications that the book would be published before sixth season of the HBO show but in early January 2016 Martin confirmed that he had not met an end-of-year deadline that he had established with his publisher for release of the book before the sixth season. He added that there was \"a lot still left to write\" and that completion of the book was \"months away still...if the writing goes well.\" Martin also revealed there had been a previous deadline of October 2015 that he had considered achievable in May 2015, and that in September 2015 he had still considered the end-of-year deadline achievable. He further confirmed that some of the plot of the book might be revealed in the upcoming season of \"Game of Thrones\". In February 2016, Martin stated that he dropped all his editing projects except for \"Wild Cards\", and that he would not be writing any teleplays, screenplays, short stories, introductions or forewords before delivering \"The Winds of Winter\".\n\nDuring the Guadalajara International Book Fair in Mexico in early December 2016, Martin offered the following hint as to the tone of this book. \"There are a lot of dark chapters right now ... Iâve been telling you for 20 years that winter was coming. Winter is the time when things die, and cold and ice and darkness fill the world, so this is not going to be the happy feel-good that people may be hoping for. Some of the characters [are] in very dark places.\"\n\nMartin is firm about ending the series with the seventh novel \"until I decide not to be firm\". With his stated goal to tell the story from beginning to end, he will not truncate the story to fit into an arbitrary number of volumes. He knows the ending in broad strokes as well as the future of the main characters, and will finish the series with bittersweet elements where not everyone will live happily ever after. Martin hopes to write an ending similar to \"The Lord of the Rings\" that he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance. On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid a situation like the finale of the TV series \"Lost\", which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires. In 2015, Martin said that he was not writing \"A Dream of Spring\" together with \"The Winds of Winter\", and in early 2016, he said he did not believe \"A Dream of Spring\" would be published before the last season of the HBO show.\n\nMartin offered the following hint as to how the series would conclude during a Q&A at the Guadalajara International Book Fair. \"Iâm not going to tell you how Iâm going to end my book, but I suspect the overall flavor is going to be as much bittersweet as it is happy.\"\n\nEarly during the development of the TV series, Martin told major plot points to producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss in case he should die. (\"The New York Times\" reported in 2011 that, at age 62, Martin was by all accounts in robust health.) Martin was confident he would have published at least \"The Winds of Winter\" before the TV series overtook him. Nevertheless, there was general concern about whether Martin would be able to stay ahead of the show. As a result, head writers Benioff and Weiss learned more future plot points from Martin in 2013 to help them set up the show's new possible seasons. This included the end stories for all the core characters. Deviations from the books' storylines are also being considered, but a two-year show hiatus to wait for new books is not an option for them as the child actors continue to grow and the show's popularity would wane. Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series. On January 2, 2016, Martin confirmed that the sixth volume would not be published before the start of the sixth season of the HBO series.\n\nRegarding \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" as his magnum opus, Martin is certain never to write anything on this scale again and would only return to this fictional universe in the context of stand-alone novels. He prefers to write stories about characters from other \"Ice and Fire\" periods of history such as his \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" project, instead of continuing the series directly. A possible future side project is a prequel set during Aegon's conquest of Westeros. Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery. However, he will see if his audience follows him after publishing his next project.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin believes the most profound influences to be the ones experienced in childhood. Having read H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, Robert A. Heinlein, Eric Frank Russell, Andre Norton, Isaac Asimov, Fritz Leiber, and Mervyn Peake in his youth, Martin never categorized these authors' literature into science fiction, fantasy, or horror and will write from any genre as a result. Martin classified \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" as \"epic fantasy\", and specifically named Tad Williams as very influential for the writing of the series. One of his favorite authors is Jack Vance, although Martin considered the series not particularly Vancean.\n\nThe medieval setting has been the traditional background for epic fantasy. However, where historical fiction leaves versed readers knowing the historical outcome, original characters may increase suspense and empathy for the readers. Yet Martin felt historical fiction, particularly when set during the Middle Ages, had an excitement, grittiness, and a realness to it that was absent in fantasy with a similar backdrop. Thus, he wanted to combine the realism of historical fiction with the magic appeal of the best fantasies, subduing magic in favor of battles and political intrigue. He also decided to avoid the conventional good versus evil setting typical for the genre, using the fight between Achilles and Hector in Homer's \"Iliad\", where no one stands out as either a hero or a villain, as an example of what he wants to achieve with his books.\n\nMartin is widely credited with broadening the fantasy fiction genre for adult content, including incest, paedophilia, and adultery. For \"The Washington Post\" Writing for \"The Atlantic\", Amber Taylor assessed the novels as hard fantasy with vulnerable characters to which readers become emotionally attached. CNN found in 2000 that Martin's mature descriptions were \"far more frank than those found in the works of other fantasy authors\", although Martin assessed the fantasy genre to have become rougher-edged a decade later and that some writers' work was going beyond the mature themes of his novels. Adam Roberts called Martin's series the most successful and popular example of the emerging subgenre of grimdark fantasy, influencing other writers associated with that style, such as Joe Abercrombie.\n\nSetting out to write something on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages in the very early stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the \"Ice and Fire\" series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. Martin still types his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10Â am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.\n\nMartin set the \"Ice and Fire\" story in a secondary world inspired by Tolkien's writing. Unlike Tolkien, who created entire languages, mythologies, and histories for Middle-earth long before writing \"The Lord of the Rings\", Martin usually starts with a rough sketch of an imaginary world that he improvises into a workable fictional setting along the way. He described his writing as coming from a subconscious level in \"almost a daydreaming process\", and his stories, which have a mythic rather than a scientific core, draw from emotion instead of rationality. Martin employs maps and a cast list topping 60 pages in the fourth volume, but keeps most information in his mind. His imagined backstory remains subject to change until published, and only the novels count as canon. Martin does not intend to publish his private notes after the series is finished.\n\nMartin drew much inspiration from actual history for the series, having several bookcases filled with medieval history for research and visiting historic European landmarks. For an American who speaks only English, the history of England proved the easiest source of medieval history for him, giving the series a British rather than a German or Spanish historic flavor. For example, Ned and Robb Stark resemble Richard, 3rd Duke of York and his son Edward IV, and Queen Cersei resembles both Margaret of Anjou and Elizabeth Woodville. Martin immersed himself in many diverse medieval topics such as clothing, food, feasting, and tournaments, to have the facts at hand if needed during writing. The series was in particular influenced by the Hundred Years' War, the Crusades, the Albigensian Crusade, and the Wars of the Roses, although Martin refrained from making any direct adaptations. Martin was also inspired by the French historical novels \"The Accursed Kings\" by Maurice Druon, which are about the French monarchy in the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nThe story is written to follow principal landmarks with an ultimate destination, but leaves Martin room for improvisation. On occasion, improvised details significantly affected the planned story. By the fourth book, Martin kept more private notes than ever before to keep track of the many subplots, which became so detailed and sprawling by the fifth book as to be unwieldy. Martin's editors, copy editors, and readers monitor for accidental mistakes, although some errors have slipped into publication. For instance, Martin has inconsistently referred to certain characters' eye colors, and has described a horse as being of one sex and then another.\n\nThe books are divided into chapters, each one narrated in the third person limited through the eyes of a point of view character, an approach Martin learned himself as a young journalism student. Beginning with nine POV characters in \"A Game of Thrones\", the number of POV characters grows to a total of 31 in \"A Dance with Dragons\" (see table). The short-lived one-time POV characters are mostly restricted to the prologue and epilogue. David Orr of \"The New York Times\" noted the story importance of \"the Starks (good guys), the Targaryens (at least one good guy, or girl), the Lannisters (conniving), the Greyjoys (mostly conniving), the Baratheons (mixed bag), the Tyrells (unclear) and the Martells (ditto), most of whom are feverishly endeavoring to advance their ambitions and ruin their enemies, preferably unto death\". However, as \"Time\" Lev Grossman noted, readers \"experience the struggle for Westeros from all sides at once\", such that \"every fight is both triumph and tragedy [...] and everybody is both hero and villain at the same time\".\n\nModeled on \"The Lord of the Rings\", the \"Ice and Fire\" story begins with a tight focus on a small group (with everyone in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning point in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin is said to have reached the turning point in \"A Dance with Dragons\", or to not quite have reached it yet in the books. The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by \"Wild Cards\", a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.\n\nInfluenced by his television and film scripting background, Martin tries to keep readers engrossed by ending each \"Ice and Fire\" chapter with a tense or revelational moment, a twist or a cliffhanger, similar to a TV act break. Scriptwriting has also taught him the technique of \"cutting out the fat and leaving the muscle\", which is the final stage of completing a book, a technique that brought the page count in \"A Dance with Dragons\" down almost eighty pages. Dividing the continuous \"Ice and Fire\" story into books is much harder for Martin. Each book shall represent a phase of the journey that ends in closure for most characters. A smaller portion of characters is left with clear-cut cliffhangers to make sure readers come back for the next installment, although \"A Dance with Dragons\" had more cliffhangers than Martin originally intended. Both one-time and regular POV characters are designed to have full character arcs ending in tragedy or triumph, and are written to hold the readers' interest and not be skipped in reading. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not rely on the hero to come through unscathed and will instead feel the character's fear with each page turn.\n\nThe unresolved larger narrative arc encourages speculation about future story events. According to Martin, much of the key to \"Ice and Fire\" future lies over a dozen years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more. Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is careful not to make the story predictable. The viewpoint characters, who serve as unreliable narrators, may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events. Therefore, what the readers believe to be true may not necessarily be true.\n\nRegarding the characters as the heart of the story, Martin planned the epic \"Ice and Fire\" fantasy to have a large cast of characters and many different settings from the beginning. \"A Feast for Crows\" has a 63-page list of characters, with many of the thousands of characters mentioned only in passing or disappearing from view for long stretches. When Martin adds a new family to the ever-growing number of genealogies in the appendices, he devises a secret about the personality or fate of the family members. However, their backstory remains subject to change until written down in the story. Martin drew most character inspiration from history (without directly translating historical figures) and his own experiences, but also from the manners of his friends, acquaintances, and people of public interest. Martin aims to \"make my characters real and to make them human, characters who have good and bad, noble and selfish well-mixed in their natures\". Jeff VanderMeer of the \"Los Angeles Times\" remarked that \"Martin's devotion to fully inhabiting his characters, for better or worse, creates the unstoppable momentum in his novels and contains an implied criticism of Tolkien's moral simplicity\" (see Themes: Moral ambiguity).\n\nMartin deliberately ignored the writing rule of never giving two characters names starting with the same letter. Instead, character names reflect the naming systems in various European family histories, where particular names were associated with specific royal houses and where even the secondary families assigned the same names repeatedly. The \"Ice and Fire\" story therefore has children called \"Robert\" in honor of King Robert of House Baratheon, a \"Brandon\" in every other generation of the Starks in commemoration of Brandon the Builder (of the Wall), and the syllable \"Ty\" commonly occurring in given names of House Lannister. Confident that readers would pay attention, Martin distinguished people sharing a given name by adding numbers or locations to their given names (e.g. Henry V of England). The family names were designed in association with ethnic groups (see backstory): the First Men in the North of Westeros had very simply descriptive names like Stark and Strong, whereas the descendants of the Andal invaders in the South have more elaborate, undescriptive house names like Lannister or Arryn, and the Targaryens and Valyrians from the Eastern continent have the most exotic names with the letter Y.\n\nAll characters are designed to speak with their own internal voices to capture their views of the world. \"The Atlantic\" pondered whether Martin ultimately intended the readers to sympathize with characters on both sides of the LannisterâStark feud long before plot developments force them to make their emotional choices. Contrary to most conventional epic fantasies, the \"Ice and Fire\" characters are vulnerable so that, according to \"The Atlantic\", the reader \"cannot be sure that good shall triumph, which makes those instances where it does all the more exulting.\" Martin gets emotionally involved in the characters' lives during writing, which makes the chapters with dreadful events sometimes very difficult to write. Seeing the world through the characters' eyes requires a certain amount of empathy with them, including the villains, all of whom he has said he loves as if they were his own children. Martin found that some characters had minds of their own and took his writing in different directions. He returns to the intended story if it does not work out, but these detours sometimes prove more rewarding for him.\n\nArya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen generate the most feedback from readers. Martin has stated that Tyrion is his personal favorite, as the grayest of the gray characters, with his cunning and wit making him the most fun to write. Martin has also said that Bran Stark is the hardest character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran's story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character, and has to deal with the series' adult themes like grief, loneliness, and anger. Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, but, as it was implausible for a character to take two months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section Bridging the timeline gap).\n\nAlthough modern fantasy may often embrace strangeness, the \"Ice and Fire\" series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.\n\nSince Martin drew on historical sources to build the \"Ice and Fire\" world, Damien G. Walter of \"The Guardian\" saw a strong resemblance between Westeros and England in the period of the Wars of the Roses. \"The Atlantic\" Adam Serwer regarded \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" as \"more a story of politics than one of heroism, a story about humanity wrestling with its baser obsessions than fulfilling its glorious potential\", where the emergent power struggle stems from the feudal system's repression and not from the fight between good and evil. Martin not only wanted to reflect the frictions of the medieval class structures in the novels, but also explore the consequences of the leaders' decisions, as general goodness does not automatically make competent leaders and vice versa.\n\nA common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not mirroring the real world. Attracted to gray characters instead of orcs and angels, Martin instead endorses Nobel Prize laureate William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Just like people's capacity for good and for evil in real life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the \"Ice and Fire\" series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that, unlike in many other fantasies, the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint. The reader may then decide about good and evil through the novels' actions and politics.\n\nAlthough fantasy comes from an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest necessity to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.\n\nAccording to Martin, the fantasy genre rarely focuses on sex and sexuality as much as the \"Ice and Fire\" books do, instead often treating sexuality in a juvenile way or neglecting it completely. Martin, however, considers sexuality an important driving force in human life that should not be excluded from the narrative. Providing sensory detail for an immersive experience is more important than plot advancement for Martin, who aims to let the readers experience the novels' sex scenes, \"whether it's a great transcendent, exciting, mind blowing sex, or whether it's disturbing, twisted, dark sex, or disappointing perfunctory sex.\" Martin was fascinated by medieval contrasts where knights venerated their ladies with poems and wore their favors in tournaments while their armies mindlessly raped women in wartime. The non-existent concept of adolescence in the Middle Ages served as a model for Daenerys' sexual activity at the age of 13 in the books. The novels also allude to the incestuous practices in the Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt to keep their bloodlines pure.\n\nMartin provides a variety of female characters to explore some of the ramifications of the novels being set in a patriarchal society. Writing all characters as human beings with the same basic needs, dreams, and influences, his female characters are to cover the same wide spectrum of human traits as the males. Martin can identify with all point-of-view characters in the writing process despite significant differences to him, be it gender or age.\n\n\"Science Fiction Weekly\" stated in 2000 that \"few would dispute that Martin's most monumental achievement to date has been the groundbreaking \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" historical fantasy series\", for which reviews have been \"orders of magnitude better\" than for his previous works, as Martin described to \"The New Yorker\". In 2007, \"Weird Tales\" magazine described the series as a \"superb fantasy saga\" that \"raised Martin to a whole new level of success\". Shortly before the release of \"A Dance with Dragons\" in 2011, Bill Sheehan of \"The Washington Post\" was sure that \"no work of fantasy has generated such anticipation since Harry Potter's final duel with Voldemort\", and Ethan Sacks of \"Daily News\" saw the series turning Martin into a darling of literary critics as well as mainstream readers, which was \"rare for a fantasy genre that's often dismissed as garbage not fit to line the bottom of a dragon's cage\". Salon.com's Andrew Leonard stated:The success is all the more remarkable because [the series debuted] without mass market publicity or any kind of buzz in the fantasy/SF scene. George R. R. Martin earned his following the hard way, by word of mouth, by hooking his characters into the psyche of his readers to an extent that most writers of fantasy only dream of.\"Publishers Weekly\" noted in 2000 that \"Martin may not rival Tolkien or Robert Jordan, but he ranks with such accomplished medievalists of fantasy as Poul Anderson and Gordon Dickson.\" After the fourth volume came out in 2005, \"Time\" Lev Grossman considered Martin a \"major force for evolution in fantasy\" and proclaimed him \"the American Tolkien\", explaining that, although Martin was \"[not] the best known of America's straight-up fantasy writers\" at the time and would \"never win a Pulitzer or a National Book AwardÂ ... his skill as a crafter of narrative exceeds that of almost any literary novelist writing today\". As Grossman said in 2011, the phrase \"American Tolkien\" \"has stuck to [Martin], as it was meant to\", being picked up by the media including \"The New York Times\" (\"He's much better than that\"), the \"New Yorker\", \"Entertainment Weekly\" (\"an acclaim that borders on fantasy blasphemy\"), \"The Globe and Mail\", and \"USA Today\". \"Time\" magazine named Martin one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and \"USA Today\" named George R.R. Martin their Author of the Year 2011.\n\nAccording to \"The Globe and Mail\" John Barber, Martin manages simultaneously to master and transcend the genre so that \"Critics applaud the depth of his characterizations and lack of clichÃ© in books that are nonetheless replete with dwarves and dragons\". \"Publishers Weekly\" gave favorable reviews to the first three \"Ice and Fire\" novels at their points of release, saying that \"A Game of Thrones\" had \"superbly developed characters, accomplished prose and sheer bloody-mindedness\", that \"A Clash of Kings\" was \"notable particularly for the lived-in quality of [their fictional world and] for the comparatively modest role of magic\", and that \"A Storm of Swords\" was one \"of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy\". However, they found that \"A Feast For Crows\" as the fourth installment \"sorely misses its other half. The slim pickings here are tasty, but in no way satisfying.\" Their review for \"A Dance with Dragons\" repeated points of criticism for the fourth volume, and said that, although \"The new volume has a similar feel to \"Feast\"\", \"Martin keeps it fresh by focusing on popular characters [who were] notably absent from the previous book.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Martin's brilliance in evoking atmosphere through description is an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings much more than just props on a painted stage\", and the novels captivate readers with \"complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters\". CNN remarked that \"the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style\", and David Orr of \"The New York Times\" found that \"All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles.\" Salon.com's Andrew Leonard \"couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire to know what was going to happen combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted.\" \"The Christian Science Monitor\" advised reading the novels with an \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" encyclopedia at hand to \"catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [Martin] leaves throughout his books. If you pay attention, you will be rewarded and questions will be answered.\"\n\nAmong the most critical voices were Sam Jordison and Michael Hann, both of \"The Guardian\". Jordison detailed his misgivings about \"A Game of Thrones\" in a 2009 review and summarized \"It's daft. It's unsophisticated. It's cartoonish. And yet, I couldn't stop readingÂ ... Archaic absurdity aside, Martin's writing is excellent. His dialogue is snappy and frequently funny. His descriptive prose is immediate and atmospheric, especially when it comes to building a sense of deliciously dark foreboding [of the long impending winter].\" Hann did not consider the novels to stand out from the general fantasy genre, despite Martin's alterations to fantasy convention, although he rediscovered his childhood's views:That when things are, on the whole, pretty crappy [in the real world], it's a deep joy to dive headfirst into something so completely immersive, something from which there is no need to surface from hours at a time. And if that immersion involves dragons, magic, wraiths from beyond death, shapeshifting wolves and banished princes, so be it.\n\nThe reported overall sales figures of the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series vary. \"The New Yorker\" said in April 2011 (before the publication of \"A Dance with Dragons\") that more than 15Â million \"Ice and Fire\" books had been sold worldwide, a figure repeated by \"The Globe and Mail\" in July 2011. Reuters reported in September 2013 that the books including print, digital and audio versions have sold more than 24Â million copies in North America. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported more than six million sold copies in North America by May 2011. \"USA Today\" reported 8.5Â million copies in print and digital overall in July 2011, and over 12Â million sold copies in print in December 2011. The series has been translated into more than 20 languages; \"USA Today\" reported the fifth book to be translated into over 40 languages. \"Forbes\" estimated that Martin was the 12th highest-earning author worldwide in 2011 at $15Â million.\n\nMartin's publishers initially expected \"A Game of Thrones\" to be a best-seller, but the first installment did not even reach any lower positions in bestseller list. This left Martin unsurprised, as it is \"a fool's game to think anything is going to be successful or to count on it\". However, the book slowly won the passionate advocacy of independent booksellers and the book's popularity grew by word of mouth. The series' popularity skyrocketed in subsequent volumes, with the second and third volume making \"The New York Times\" Best Seller lists in 1999 and 2000, respectively. The series gained Martin's old writings new attention, and Martin's American publisher Bantam Spectra was to reprint his out-of-print solo novels.\n\nThe fourth installment, \"A Feast for Crows\", was an immediate best-seller at its 2005 release, hitting number one on \"The New York Times\" hardcover fiction bestseller list November 27, 2005, which for a fantasy novel suggested that Martin's books were attracting mainstream readers. The paperback edition of \"A Game of Thrones\" reached its 34th printing in 2010, surpassing the one million mark. Before it even premiered, the TV series had boosted sales of the book series, with \"Ice and Fire\" approaching triple-digit growth in year-on-year sales. Bantam was looking forward to seeing the tie-ins boost sales further, and Martin's British publisher Harper Voyager expected readers to rediscover their other epic fantasy literature. With a reported 4.5Â million copies of the first four volumes in print in early 2011, the four volumes re-appeared on the paperback fiction bestseller lists in the second quarter of 2011.\n\nAt its point of publication in July 2011, \"A Dance with Dragons\" was in its sixth print with more than 650,000 hardbacks in print. It also had the highest single and first-day sales of any new fiction title published in 2011 at that point, with 170,000 hardcovers, 110,000 e-books, and 18,000 audio books reportedly sold on the first day. \"A Dance with Dragons\" reached the top of \"The New York Times\" bestseller list on July 31, 2011. Unlike most other big titles, the fifth volume sold more physical than digital copies early on, but nevertheless, Martin became the tenth author to sell 1Â million Amazon Kindle e-books. All five volumes and the four-volume boxed set were among the top 100 best-selling books in the United States in 2011 and 2012.\n\nThe TV series has contributed significantly boosting sales of both the books and collectibles like box-sets, merchandise, and other items. The TV series also contributed in increasing the geographic coverage of the books, introducing new customers in emerging countries like India and Brazil to the book series. All this has significantly increased the overall book sales.\n\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, Martin's novels had slowly earned him a reputation in science fiction circles, although he said to only have received a few fans' letters a year in the pre-internet days. The publication of \"A Game of Thrones\" caused Martin's following to grow, with fan sites springing up and a Trekkie-like society of followers evolving that meet regularly. Westeros.org, one of the main \"Ice and Fire\" fansites with about seventeen thousand registered members as of 2011, was established in 1999 by a Swedish-based fan of Cuban-American descent, Elio M. GarcÃ­a, Jr., and his girlfriend; their involvement with Martin's work has now become semi-professional. The Brotherhood Without Banners, an unofficial fan club operating globally, was formed in 2001. Their founders and other longtime members are among Martin's good friends.\n\nMartin runs an official website and administers a lively blog with the assistance of Ty Franck. He also interacts with fandom by answering emails and letters, although he stated in 2005 that their sheer numbers might leave them unanswered for years. Since there are different types of conventions nowadays, he tends to go to three or four science-fiction conventions a year simply to go back to his roots and meet friends. He does not read message boards anymore, so that his writing will not be influenced by fans foreseeing twists and interpreting characters differently from what he intended.\n\nWhile Martin calls the majority of his fans \"great\", and enjoys interacting with them, some of them turned against him because of the six years it took to release \"A Dance with Dragons\". A movement of disaffected fans called GRRuMblers formed in 2009, creating sites such as \"Finish the Book, George\" and \"Is Winter Coming?\". When fans' vocal impatience for \"A Dance with Dragons\" peaked shortly after, Martin issued a statement called \"To My Detractors\" on his blog that received media attention. \"The New York Times\" noted that it was not uncommon for Martin to be mobbed at book signings either. \"The New Yorker\" called this \"an astonishing amount of effort to devote to denouncing the author of books one professes to love. Few contemporary authors can claim to have inspired such passion.\"\n\n\nMartin has written several prequel novellas. The \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" series, three novellas set ninety years before the events of the novel series, feature the adventures of Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire \"Egg\", the later King Aegon V Targaryen. The stories have no direct connection to the plot of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", although both characters are mentioned in \"A Storm of Swords\" and \"A Feast For Crows\", respectively. The first installment, \"The Hedge Knight\", was published in the 1998 anthology \"Legends\". \"The Sworn Sword\" followed in 2003, published in \"Legends II\". Both were later adapted into graphic novels. The third novella, titled \"The Mystery Knight\", was first published in the 2010 anthology \"Warriors\", and is planned to be adapted as a graphic novel as well. Martin planned to release the first three novellas as one collection in 2014. Up to eight further \"Dunk and Egg\" installments are planned.\n\nThe novella \"The Princess and the Queen or, the Blacks and the Greens\" appeared in Tor Books's 2013 anthology \"Dangerous Women\", and explains some of the Targaryen backstory two centuries before the events of the novels. \"The Rogue Prince, or, the King's Brother\", published in the 2014 anthology \"Rogues\", is itself a prequel to the events of \"The Princess and the Queen\".\n\nChapter sets from the novels were also compiled into three novellas that were released between 1996 and 2003 by \"Asimov's Science Fiction\" and \"Dragon\":\n\nWith the popularity of the series growing, HBO optioned \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" for a television adaptation in 2007. A pilot episode was produced in late 2009, and a series commitment for nine further episodes was made in March 2010. The series, titled \"Game of Thrones\", premiered in April 2011 to great acclaim and ratings (see \"Game of Thrones\": Reception). The network picked up the show for a second season covering \"A Clash of Kings\" two days later. Shortly after the conclusion of the first season, the show received 13 Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, winning Outstanding Main Title Design and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for Peter Dinklage's portrayal of Tyrion Lannister. HBO announced a renewal for a third season in April 2012, ten days after the season 2 premiere. Due to the length of the corresponding book, the third season only covered roughly the first half of \"A Storm of Swords\". \n\nShortly after the season 3 premiere in March 2013, the network announced that \"Game of Thrones\" would be returning for a fourth season, which would cover the second half of \"A Storm of Swords \"along with the beginnings of \"A Feast for Crows \"and \"A Dance With Dragons\". \"Game of Thrones\" was nominated for 15 Emmy Awards for season 3. Two days after the fourth season premiered in April 2014, HBO renewed \"Game of Thrones\" for a fifth and sixth season. Season 5 premiered on April 12, 2015 and set a Guinness World Records for winning the highest number of Emmy Awards for a series in a single season and year, winning 12 out of 24 nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series.\nThese episodes were watched by 8Â million viewers, setting a record number for the series. The sixth season premiered on April 24, 2016. These episodes received the most nominations for the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards with 23, winning 12, including the award for Outstanding Drama Series.\n\n\"A Song of Ice and Fire\" spawned an industry of spin-off products. Fantasy Flight Games released a collectible card game, a board game, and two collections of artwork inspired by the \"Ice and Fire\" series. Various roleplaying game products were released by Guardians of Order and Green Ronin. Dynamite Entertainment adapted \"A Game of Thrones\" into a same-titled monthly comic in 2011. Several video games are available or in production, including \"\" (2011) and \"Game of Thrones\" (2012) by Cyanide; both received mediocre ratings from critics. A social network game titled \"Game of Thrones Ascent\" (2013) by Disruptor Beam allows players to live the life of a noble during the series' period setting. Random House released an official map book called \"The Lands of Ice and Fire\", which includes old and new maps of the \"Ice and Fire\" world. The companion book \"The World of Ice & Fire\" by Martin and the Westeros.org owners Elio M. GarcÃ­a Jr. and Linda Antonsson was published in October 2014. Other licensed products include full-sized weapon reproductions, a range of collectable figures, Westeros coinage reproductions, and a large number of gift and collectible items based on the HBO television series. The popularity of the HBO series has made its version of the Iron Throne an icon of the entire media franchise.\n\n\n", "id": "12301", "title": "A Song of Ice and Fire"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12302", "text": "World of A Song of Ice and Fire\n\nThe fictional world in which the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" novels by George R. R. Martin take place is divided into several continents. Most of the story takes place on the continent Westeros, in a large political entity known as the Seven Kingdoms. It actually consists of nine regions (the North, the Iron Islands, the Riverlands, the Vale, the Westerlands, the Stormlands, the Reach, the Crownlands, and Dorne) and a largely unmapped area to the north, separated by a massive wall of ice and old magic. The vast continent of Essos lies to the east of Westeros, across the Narrow Sea. The closest foreign nations to Westeros are the Free Cities, a collection of independent city-states along the western edge of this eastern continent. The lands along the southern coastline of the eastern continent, collectively called the Lands of the Summer Sea, include Slavers Bay and the ruins of Valyria, the former home of Westeros' Targaryen kings. To the south of Essos lie the continents of Sothoryos and Ulthos, which in the narrative are largely unexplored.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin set the \"Ice and Fire\" story in an alternative world of Earth, a \"secondary world\", such as J. R. R. Tolkien pioneered with Middle-earth. The \"Ice and Fire\" narrative can be considered to be set in a post-magic world where people no longer believe in supernatural things such as the Others, and while the characters understand the natural aspects of their world, they cannot comprehend its magical elements. Religion, though, has a significant role in the life of people with the characters practising many different religions.\n\nThe story takes place primarily on a continent called Westeros, which is roughly the size of South America. The continent is home to the Seven Kingdoms and lands beyond the great Wall, which makes up a large chunk of Westeros, being roughly the size of Canada, with most of it largely unmapped and unexplored. Westeros is at the mercy of erratic seasons of unpredictable duration that last for many years. At the beginning of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" the continent has enjoyed a decade-long summer, and many fear that an equally long and harsh winter will follow.\n\nAt the novel's beginning, the majority of Westeros is united under the rule of a king, with each of nine regions controlled by a different major house. Martin here drew inspiration from medieval European history: in particular the Hundred Years' War, the Crusades, the Albigensian Crusade, and the Wars of the Roses. The first inhabitants of the continent were the Children of the Forest: a nature-worshipping anthropoid species who carved the faces of their gods in weirwood trees. Some time later, the First Men's attempts at cultivating the land led to a war with the Children and was eventually settled by an agreement known as \"the Pact\", signalling the beginning of the Age of Heroes. During that time, the First Men adopted the Children's gods, that later became known in Westeros as the Old gods.\n\nEight thousand years before the events of the novels, an enigmatic species called the Others emerged from the furthermost north, accompanying a winter named \"The Long Night\" that lasted decades, whereafter the Children of the Forest and the First Men jointly repelled the Others, and a massive Wall was erected barring passage from the far north.\n\nSome time later, the Andals invaded Westeros and established the Faith of the Seven, writing, and steel. Only the North remained unconquered and the Children disappeared from Andal lands. Over time seven kingdoms were forged across Westeros: The North, The Iron Islands, The Vale, The Westerlands, The Stormlands, The Reach, and Dorne. The Seven Kingdoms were constantly at war with one another, and no Kingdom remained dominant for long.\n\nThree hundred years before the novels begin, Aegon the Conqueror and his two Targaryen sister-wives from Dragonstone and landed in what is now known as King's Landing. Their powerful dragons overwhelmed six of the Seven Kingdoms through conquest or treaty, but Dorne remained independent for another two-hundred years until it was absorbed through marriage-alliance. The Targaryens made the Iron Throne from the swords of the defeated rulers, fused by dragonfire, establishing King's Landing as their capital city, and remained the ruling power on the continent until deposed by Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon.\n\nPart of the narrative in \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" lies across the narrow sea from Westeros, an area comprising the large eastern continent named Essos. Being roughly the size of Eurasia, Essos has geography and climate that vary greatly. The western coastline is characterized by green rolling hills, the massive Forest of Qohor, and extensive island chains such as Braavos and Lys. The middle of the continent is covered by the flat grasslands of the Dothraki Sea and the arid lands known as the Red Waste to the east. Beyond the Red Waste lies the city of Qarth. The south is dominated by dry rolling hills and has a Mediterranean climate, with a coastline along the Summer Sea and Slaver's Bay. The north coast of the mainland is separated from the polar cap by the Shivering Sea. To the south, across the Summer Sea, lies the uncharted jungle continent of Sothoryos.\n\nMuch of the fictional history of Essos relates to Valyria, a city located on a peninsula in southern Essos and the origin of House Targaryen before the destruction of the Valyrian Empire in an unspecified cataclysm. After the destruction of Valyria, the cities of Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen regained independence and ruled their respective areas as city-states. The area is known in the books as Slaver's Bay.\n\nTo the south of Essos lies the continent of Sothoryos, also spelled Sothoros in the novels. The continent is first named on a map in \"A Storm of Swords\" (2000), showing the cities of Yeen and Zamettar on it. The narrative itself first refers to the continent in \"A Feast for Crows\" (2005). Martin had described Sothoryos in 2002 as \"the southern continent, roughly equivalent to Africa, jungly, plague-ridden, and largely unexplored\". The novels provide little other information. The swampy nature of Sothoryos is briefly referenced by Victarion in \"A Dance with Dragons\", and teak from Sothoryos is said to be used to build ships. A corsair's road runs along the continent's northern coast. \"A Dance with Dragons\" refers to the diseases on Sothoryos in regards to the wealthy but sick Yunkai slave trader Yezzan zo Qaggaz. Victarion compares some people as \"squat and hairy as the apes of Sothoros\", and some people fighting in Daznak's Pit for Daenerys's entertainment in \"A Dance with Dragons\" are described as \"brindle-skinned half-men from the jungles of Sothoros\". Martin said that, unlike other peoples in the novels, the brindled men of Sothoryos were pure fantasy constructs.\n\nThe map collection \"The Lands of Ice and Fire\" also shows the north tip of a landmass named \"Ulthos\" to the south of Essos and east of Sothoryos. Asked whether this was another continent, Martin replied, \"Well, it's a large landmass. I am a little unclear on the formal definition of 'continent' as opposed to 'big island.' Also on the size of Ulthos, which after all sits at the edge of the known world. Terra incognita and all that.\"\n\n\"A Game of Thrones\", the first installment of the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series, has two maps of Westeros. Each new book has added one or two maps so that, as of \"A Dance with Dragons\", seven individual maps of the fictional world are available in the books (see table). Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were deliberately not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were unilluminated about distant places. He also did not \"subscribe to the theory put forth in \"The Tough Guide To Fantasyland\" [...] that eventually the characters must visit every place shown on The Map.\" However, he said readers may be able to piece together a world map by the end of the series. He was intentionally vague with the size of the \"Ice and Fire\" world, omitting a scale on the maps to discourage prediction of travel lengths based on measured distances. Map artists changed during the writing of \"A Dance with Dragons\" so that the maps are available in two versions by James Sinclair and Jeffrey L. Ward, depending on the books. The old maps were redone to match the style of the new ones.\n\nA set of foldout maps was published on 30 October 2012 as \"The Lands of Ice and Fire\" (ISBN 978-0345538543). The maps are drawn by illustrator and cartographer Jonathan Roberts based on drafts by George R. R. Martin. The twelve maps in the set are: The Known World, The West, Central Essos, The East, Westeros, Beyond The Wall, The Free Cities, Slaver's Bay, The Dothraki Sea, King's Landing, Braavos and \"Journeys\", which tracks the paths taken by the novels' characters.\n\nFor details about map use in the television adaptation, please see Game of Thrones title sequence.\n\nThe North consists of the northern half of the Seven Kingdoms and is ruled by House Stark from Winterfell. The North is nearly as big as the other six kingdoms combined, but only sparsely populated. Martin compared the North to Scotland. It is cold in the North; mild snows are common regardless of season, whereas the winters are described as hard. The region's northern border is the New Gift, a stretch of land 50 leagues wide in possession of the Night's Watch. An isthmus of swampland named the Neck separates the North from the South; it is home to small, marsh-dwelling crannogmen and ruled by House Reed of Greywater Watch, bannermen of House Stark. The Neck's narrowness and difficult terrain along with the almost impenetrable Moat Cailin make it a natural border for the North, protecting it from invasion. The city of White Harbor is described as a thriving port. Illegitimate children born of a noble parent in the North are given the surname Snow.\n\nWinterfell is the name given to the ancestral castle of House Stark. It is built over a natural hot spring and the scalding water runs through the castle walls, warming halls and rooms. There are several open pools where heated water collects within the godswood. The hot spring also prevents the ground from freezing both in summer and winter. The castle has deep catacombs where the bodies of Starks are entombed behind statues in their likeness with a direwolf at their feet and their swords left in their hands. The tombs range back all the way to the old Kings of the North, called the Kings of Winter, who ruled before Aegon the Conqueror and the arrival of the Andals before that.\n\nThe pilot and Season 1 of the TV adaptation used the 16th century clock tower and ancient courtyard of Clearsky Activity Centre located at Castle Ward in County Down, Northern Ireland, for Winterfell. Doune Castle in Stirling, Scotland, previously featured as Castle Anthrax in the film \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", was also used for exterior scenes at Winterfell. Saintfield Estates stood in as Winterfell's godswood (an enclosed wooded area where characters who worship the old gods can pray beside trees with faces carved in them). A car park stood in for Winterfell's courtyard and a wine cellar for the Stark family crypt. Tollymore Forest featured prominently in the prologue of the pilot episode and the pivotal scene where the Starks first find the direwolves. Cairncastle, meanwhile, served as the location where Ned Stark beheads the deserter Will south of the Wall.\" The interior of Winterfell, such as the Tower of the First Keep, the Great Hall and Catelyn's bedchamber were filmed at The Paint Hall studio. Set designer Gemma Jackson said, \"Winterfell was based on a Scottish castle.\"\n\nThe Wall is a huge structure of stone, ice and magic on the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms. It is home to the Night's Watch, a brotherhood sworn to protect the realms of men from the threats beyond the Wall. The Wall was inspired by Martin's visit to Hadrian's Wall, in the North of England close to the border with Scotland. Looking out over the hills, Martin wondered what a Roman centurion from the Mediterranean would feel, not knowing what threats might come from the north. This experience was so profound that a decade later, in 1991, he wanted to \"write a story about the people guarding the end of the world\", and ultimately \"the things that come out of the [fictional] north are a good deal more terrifying than Scotsmen or Picts\". Martin adjusted the size, length, and magical nature of the Wall for genre demands; Jon Snow's chapters describe it as approximately long and high in general, rising up to a perceived in spots due to huge foundation blocks. The top is wide enough for a dozen mounted knights to ride abreast, (approximately 30Â ft or 10m) while the base is so thick that the Wall's gates are more like tunnels through the ice.\n\nThe novels' legends claim that the First Men, or more specifically Brandon the Builder with the possible help of giants, constructed the Wall some 8,000 years before the events of the series. The Wall has since been maintained by the Night's Watch to guard the realms of men against the threats from beyond, originally the Others and later against the wildling raids. A strip of land known as \"the Gift\", now stretching 50 leagues south of the wall, was given to them in perpetuity thousands of years ago for cultivation. In \"A Game of Thrones\", out of the nineteen castles built along the wall, only three are still manned: Castle Black with 600 men, and the Shadow Tower and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea with 200 men each. Parts of Castle Black have fallen into ruins.\n\nThe TV series' Castle Black and the Wall were filmed in the abandoned Magheramorne Quarry near Belfast, Northern Ireland, whereas the scenes shot atop the wall were filmed inside Paint Hall Studios. The composite set (with both exteriors and interiors) consisted of a large section of Castle Black including the courtyard, the ravenry, the mess hall and the barracks, and used the stone wall of the quarry as the basis for the ice wall that protects Westeros from the dangers that dwell beyond. They also made a functional elevator to lift the rangers to the top of the Wall. A castle with real rooms and a working elevator were built near a cliff 400 feet high. \"Working construction lifts were discovered at a nearby work site and rise 18 feet; CGI fills in the rest to make the wall appear 700 feet high.\" The area around the elevator was painted white to make it look like ice. Martin was surprised by the height and thought, \"Oh I may have made the wall too big!\" Martin said, \"It's a pretty spectacular, yet miserable location. It is wet and rainy, and the mud is thick\", which \"really gets the actors in the mood of being at the end of the world in all of this cold and damp and chill\".\n\n\"A Clash of Kings\" takes the story to the lands Beyond the Wall, although the first five books do not explore \"what lies really north [...] but we will in the last two books\". The TV adaptation used Iceland as filming location for the lands Beyond the Wall. Martin, who has never been to Iceland, said Beyond the Wall was \"considerably larger than Iceland and the area closest to my Wall is densely forested, so in that sense it's more like Canada â Hudson Bay or the Canadian forests just north of Michigan. And then as you get further and further north, it changes. You get into tundra and ice fields and it becomes more of an arctic environment. You have plains on one side and a very high range of mountains on the other. Of course, once again this is fantasy, so my mountains are more like the Himalayas.\" In an HBO featurette, Martin stated the lands beyond the wall make up a big part of Westeros, being roughly the size of Canada. The Valley of Thenn is one such location beyond the Wall, and north of that is the Lands of Always Winter, where the Others come from.\n\nDuring the first season, the HBO team used places that they could decorate with artificial snow for the north of the Wall, but a bigger landscape was chosen for Season 2. \"Primary filming for these scenes, which encompass both the Frostfangs and the Fist of the First Men, occurred at the SvÃ­nafellsjÃ¶kull calving glacier in Skaftafell, Iceland, followed by shooting near SmyrlabjÃ¶rg and VÃ­k on HÃ¶fÃ°abrekkuheiÃ°i. Benioff said, \"We always knew we wanted something shatteringly beautiful and barren and brutal for this part of Jon's journey, because he's in the true North now. It's all real. It's all in camera. We're not doing anything in postproduction to add mountains or snow or anything.\"\n\nThe Iron Islands are a group of seven islands to the west of Westeros â Pyke, Great Wyk, Old Wyk, Harlaw, Saltcliffe, Blacktyde and Orkmont â lying in Ironman's Bay off the western coast of the continent. Ruled by House Greyjoy of Pyke, the isles are described as bare and barren, and the local weather as \"windy and cold, and damp\". The members of this seafaring nation are known in the rest of Westeros as Ironmen, and to themselves as Ironborn. Illegitimate children born in the Iron Islands are given the surname Pyke.\n\nFor fierce raids, the Ironmen are titled the \"terror of the seas\". They worship the Drowned God, who \"had made them to reave and rape, to carve out kingdoms and write their names in fire and blood and song\". The appendix of \"A Game of Thrones\" summarizes that the Ironmen once ruled over the Riverlands and much of the western coast of Westeros. When Aegon the Conqueror extinguished Black Harren's line, he chose House Greyjoy as the new rulers of the Ironmen.\n\nPyke is the seat of House Greyjoy. The television adaptation filmed the scenes of Pyke's port at Lordsport Harbour in Ballintoy Harbour, in Northern Ireland's County Antrim. In the books, the castle of Pyke is built on the end of a rocky peninsula on the island of Pyke. Pyke's throne is the Seastone Chair. The sea has worn away much of the rock on which Pyke originally stood, so the castle now consists mostly of a main keep on the main island and smaller towers perched on rocks, linked by stone arches over the smaller gaps, and rope bridges over larger. Lordsport is a village on the far end of the island, overlooked by the castle of House Botley. During the Greyjoy Rebellion, Lordsport and the Botley stronghold were razed by Robert Baratheon, and Pyke was besieged and conquered by his forces. In the years since the rebellion, Lordsport has been rebuilt, except for the sept (the Westerosi equivalent of a church), and Lord Botley built a small stone keep to replace the old timber and wattle castle.\n\nOld Wyk is the smallest and holiest island in the Iron Islands. It is where Kingsmoots are held, and where the Grey King slew Nagga, a sea dragon, and made a court of his bones.\n\nThe Riverlands are the populous and fertile areas surrounding the forks of the river Trident on Westeros. While they form one of the nine regions of Westeros, the Riverlands' central location and geographic features made the region an inter-kingdom battle zone that changed hands rather than becoming its own 'eighth' kingdom of the Seven Kingdoms. Centrally located between the Westerlands, the Crownlands, the Vale and The North and lacking the natural defenses of other regions, they have seen frequent warfare. The first ruler to unite the Riverlands was Benedict Justman, but the Justman dynasty died out three centuries later. The Durrandons conquered the Riverlands, but lost rule of it to Harwyn \"Hardhand\" Hoare, King of the Iron Islands. At the time of Aegon's conquest, the Riverlands were ruled by Harwyn's grandson, Harren the Black, king of the Iron Islands, and the Tullys were local nobles who rebelled against him by joining Aegon the Conqueror. As with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins, illegitimate children born in the Riverlands are given the surname Rivers.\n\nHarrenhal is an enormous ruined castle and is the site of many important events in the novels. Harrenhal was built by Harren the Black, after his conquest of the Riverlands, intending to make it the largest fortification ever built in Westeros. The castle has been described as so large that an entire army was needed to garrison it. The Great Hall had thirty five hearths and seated thousands. Shortly after the castle was completed, Aegon the Conqueror's dragon slew Harren, his sons, and his entire army by setting the castle alight.\n\nSince then, the ruins of the castle have been occupied by a variety of houses, all of which eventually became extinct. As a result, the people of Westeros believe the castle is cursed. The logistical and economic difficulties inherent in keeping such an enormous castle maintained and garrisoned has made it something of a white elephant. At the start of the War of the Five Kings, the castle was in ruin, with only a fraction habitable, and held by Lady Shella Whent, the last of her House, who is stripped of Harrenhal when the Lannisters seize her castle. The castle changes hands repeatedly over the course of the novels, many of those holding it meeting unpleasant ends.\n\nRiverrun is the ancestral stronghold of House Tully, lords of the riverlands since the Conquest. The castle is located along one of the \"forks\" of the Trident and controls access to the interior of Westeros. The castle is bordered on two sides by the Tumblestone River and the Red Fork. The third side fronts on a massive manmade ditch, which is flooded to create a moat when the castle is under siege. It was built by Ser Axel Tully on land he received from the Andal King Armistead Vance.\n\nThe castle is the location of Robb Stark's great victory over House Lannister and the site of his crowning. By the end of the \"A Feast for Crows\", Brynden Tully surrenders the castle to Jaime Lannister to spare further bloodshed. Riverrun then passed into the hands of Emmon Frey, an ally of House Lannister.\n\nThe Twins are a heavily fortified set of castles that control movement over the river. The Twins is the seat of House Frey, and they have grown wealthy by charging a toll on all those who cross for the past six centuries. Because the Freys are both wealthy and numerous, they are one of the most powerful houses sworn to House Tully. The castle's strategic position gives House Frey enormous importance in times of war.\n\nWhen Robb Stark goes to The Twins to repair his alliance with House Frey, the Freys massacre Robb and his army: an event known as \"The Red Wedding\", and contrary to native customs of guest right. Due to this they win the enmity of most of the Seven Kingdoms, especially in the Riverlands and North.\n\nThe Vale is the area surrounded almost completely by the Mountains of the Moon in the east of Westeros. The Vale is under the rulership of House Arryn, one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility and formerly Kings of Mountain and Vale. Their seat, the Eyrie, is a castle high in the mountains, small but considered unassailable. The only way to reach the Vale is by a mountain road teeming with animals called 'shadowcats', rock slides, and dangerous mountain clans. The mountain road ends at the Vale's sole entrance, the Bloody Gate: a pair of twin watchtowers, connected by a covered bridge, on the rocky mountain slopes over a very narrow path. The protection of the surrounding mountains gives the Vale itself a temperate climate, fertile meadows, and woods. The snowmelt from the mountains and a constant waterfall that never freezes, named Alyssa's Tears, provide plentiful water. The Vale has rich black soil, wide slow-moving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes. Illegitimate children born in the Vale are given the surname Stone.\n\nBased on the German castle of Neuschwanstein, the Eyrie is the seat of House Arryn. It is situated on the Giant's Lance, and is reachable only by a narrow mule trail, guarded by the Gates of the Moon and three small castles, titled Stone, Snow, and Sky. Travelers must enter the Gates of the Moon and its upper bailey before reaching the narrow path up the mountain. The steps up the Giant's Lance starts directly behind the Gates of the Moon. The Eyrie clings to the mountain and is six hundred feet above Sky. The last part of the climb to the Eyrie is something of a cross between a chimney and a stone ladder, which leads to the Eyrie's cellar entrance. Due to the Mountains of the Moon's harsh winters, travel to and from the Eyrie is possible through the mountains only in summer.\n\nThe Eyrie is the smallest of the great castles in the story, consisting of seven slim towers bunched tightly together. It has no stables, kennels, or smithies; but the towers can house 500 men, and the granary can sustain a small household for a year or more. The Eyrie does not keep livestock on hand; whereas all dairy produce, meats, fruits, vegetables etc. must be brought from the Vale below. Its cellars hold six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies and occasionally guests from below. Oxen are used to raise and lower them; but winter snows can make supplying the fortress impossible. The Eyrie's dungeons, known as \"sky cells,\" are left open to the sky on one side and have sloping floors that put prisoners in danger of slipping or rolling off the edge. Executions in the Eyrie are carried out via the Moon Door, which opens from the high hall onto a 600-foot drop.\n\nThe Eyrie is made of pale stone and primarily decorated with the blue and white colors of House Arryn. Elegant details provide warmth and comfort through plentiful fireplaces, carpets, and luxurious fabrics. Many of the chambers are cozy and warm, with magnificent views of the Vale, the Mountains of the Moon, or the waterfall. The Maiden's Tower is the easternmost of the seven slender towers, so all the Vale can be seen from its windows and balconies. The apartments of the Lady of the Eyrie open over a small garden planted with blue flowers and ringed by white towers, containing grass and scattered statuary, with the central statue of a weeping woman believed to be Alyssa Arryn, around low, flowering shrubs. The lord's chambers have doors of solid oak, and plush velvet curtains covering windows of small rhomboid panes of glass. The High Hall has a blue silk carpet leading to the carved weirwood thrones of the Lord and Lady Arryn. The floors and walls are of milk-white marble veined with blue. Daylight enters down through high narrow arched windows along the eastern wall, and there are some fifty high iron sconces where torches may be lit. \n\nThe Eyrie was held by Lord Jon Arryn, who fostered Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon prior to Robert's Rebellion. After the war, Lord Arryn served as King Robert I Baratheon's Hand of the King (Prime Minister). After Lord Arryn was assassinated, his wife, Lady Lysa Arryn, took her sickly child, Robin, and fled to the Eyrie. Lysa refused to align herself with any of the claimants during the War of the Five Kings, but eventually pretends to a possible alliance with House Lannister after Lord Petyr Baelish agrees to marry her. Later Baelish kills Lysa after she attempts to murder her niece, Sansa Stark. As of \"Feast for Crows\", Baelish rules in the Eyrie as the Lord Protector and Regent for the sickly, epileptic Lord Robert Arryn, and plans Sansa to marry Harold Harding, who will become heir to the Eyrie and the Vale in the event of young Robert Arryn's death.\n\nFor the CGI compositions of the Vale of Arryn in the TV series, as seen in the establishing shot of the Eyrie and from the sky cells, the visual effects team used images and textures from the Greek rock formations of Meteora. Initially they had been considering the Zhangjiajie Mountains in China, but because the landscape base plates were shot in Northern Ireland, using Meteora resulted a better option. Set designer Gemma Jackson said, \"A lot of the mosaics in the Eyrie were based on a beautiful chapel I visited in Rome.\" The interior of the High Hall of the Arryns was filmed at The Paint Hall, occupying one of the four soundstages there. Martin acknowledged that the set differed significantly from its presentation in the books: \"In the books, the room is long and rectangular. But [The Paint Hall soundstage] had essentially a square space, which they chose to put a round hall in, with a staircase curving up to a throne that was high above.\"\n\nThe Westerlands are the Westerosi lands to the west of the Riverlands and north of the Reach. They are ruled by House Lannister of Casterly Rock, formerly Kings of the Rock. People of this region are often called \"Westermen.\" Lannisport, lying hard by Casterly Rock, is the chief town of the region and one of the great ports and cities of Westeros. The Westerlands are rich in precious metals, mostly gold, which is the source of their wealth. As with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins, illegitimate children born in the Westerlands are given the surname Hill.\n\nA stronghold carved from a mountain overlooking the harbor city of Lannisport and the sea beyond, Casterly Rock is the ancestral seat of House Lannister. According to popular legend, the hero known as Lann the Clever tricked the Casterlys into giving up the Rock, and took it for himself. The Rock is renowned as the wealthiest region due to its abundance of gold mining resources, and it is one of the strongest castles of the Seven Kingdoms. It has never been taken in battle, despite attacks by the Iron Islanders and the plans of Robb Stark in the War of the Five Kings. It was held by Lord Tywin Lannister prior to the War of the Five Kings, but after his death, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister made one of her cousins castellan of the castle. As of \"A Dance with Dragons\" the narrative has not actually taken place in Casterly Rock, yet descriptions of it have been offered by the Lannisters in the POV chapters.\n\nWest of Casterly Rock, on the coastline, is the city of Lannisport. A busy port under the governance of the Lannisters of Casterly Rock, Lannisport thrives as a protected, wealthy city. The city is also home to many lesser Lannisters and other people with similar surnames, such as Lannys.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin stated on his blog that he drew inspiration for Casterly Rock from the Rock of Gibraltar.\n\nThe Reach is the most lush and fertile region of Westeros, ruled by House Tyrell from Highgarden. The Tyrells were stewards to House Gardener, the Kings of the Reach before Aegon's conquest. After the last Gardener King was killed on the Field of Fire, the Tyrells surrendered Highgarden to Aegon and were rewarded with both the castle and the position of overlords of the Reach. The wealth and power of the Reach comes from their bountiful harvests of the most sought-after wines and foods. During times of war, the lengthy distance of the Reach and its abundance of foods protects their inhabitants from initial famine and sickness. In a significant political maneuver during the civil war in Westeros and the War of the Five Kings, House Tyrell provides the starving populace of King's Landing with hundreds of carts of food, ensuring the positive image of House Tyrell foremost, and the alliance for the Iron Throne with House Baratheon as secondary. However the Tyrells were responsible for the starvation in the first place, as part of their plan to help Renly usurp the Iron Throne. The most prominent city in the Reach is Oldtown. It is the oldest city in Westeros, home to the Maester's Citadel, and the previous seat of the Faith of the Seven. Illegitimate children born in the Reach are given the surname Flowers.\n\nOldtown is one of the largest cities in Westeros and is by far the oldest, built by the First Men before the Andal Invasion. It survived the invasion by welcoming the Andals rather than resisting them. The city is located in the south-western part of Westeros, at the mouth of the River Honeywine, where it opens onto Whispering Sound and the Sunset Sea beyond.\n\nOldtown is primarily known as the location of the Citadel, home of the order of Maesters who serve as councillors, doctors, scientists, and postmasters for the Seven Kingdoms. The city's Starry Sept was the seat of the Holy Faith of the Seven until the construction of the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing. Aegon the Conqueror's reign is dated from his entrance into the city of Oldtown and his acknowledgment as King by the High Septon.\n\nOldtown is the second most important port in the Seven Kingdoms after King's Landing: trading ships from the Summer Islands, the Free Cities, the eastern cities, and the rest of Westeros constantly crowd into its harbors. The city itself is described as stunningly beautiful; many rivers and canals crisscross its cobbled streets, and breathtaking stone mansions are common. The city lacks the squalor of King's Landing, which usurped its position as the pre-eminent city of Westeros.\n\nThe largest structure in the city, and also the tallest structure in Westeros, is the Hightower, a massive stepped lighthouse which extends some into the sky and is topped by a huge beacon which can be seen for many miles out to sea. Oldtown is ruled from the Hightower by House Hightower. Originally kings in their own right, they later swore fealty to the Gardeners of Highgarden, and later became vassals of the Tyrells after the Conquest. The Hightowers are known for their loyalty and stalwartness. The current ruler of the city is Lord Leyton Hightower.\n\nOldtown remained aloof from the War of the Five Kings, but late in the war the Ironborn under King Euron Greyjoy launched a massive raid along the coast, conquering the Shield Islands and parts of the Arbor before trying to blockade the mouth of the Honeywine. An attempt to attack the city harbor was repulsed by the city's defenders. Oldtown remains under threat from the Ironborn.\n\nThe Stormlands are the Westerosi areas between King's Landing and the Sea of Dorne. In the east they are bordered by Shipbreaker Bay and the Dornish Sea to the south. Before Aegon's conquest they were ruled by the Storm Kings, and afterwards by House Baratheon, bastard relatives to the Targaryens. The Dornish Marches are located within this region, and were common battlegrounds between the Stormlands and Dorne until Dorne joined the Seven Kingdoms. Illegitimate children born in the Stormlands are given the surname Storm.\n\nStorm's End is the seat of House Baratheon and, before them, the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings extending back many thousands of years. According to legend, the first Storm King in the age of the First Men was Durran, who married Elenei, the daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind. In a rage her parents sent vast storms to shatter his keep and kill his wedding guests and family; whereupon Durran declared war against the gods and raised several castles over Shipbreaker Bay, each larger and more formidable than the last. Finally, the seventh castle stayed in place and resisted the storms. Some believe the Children of the Forest took a hand in its construction; others that Brandon Stark, the builder of the Wall, advised Durran on its construction. The truth of the matter is unknown.\n\nStorm's End has never fallen to either siege or storm. Its outer defenses consist of a huge curtain wall, tall and thick on its thinnest side, nearly thick on its seaward side. The wall consists of a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble. The wall is smooth and curving, the stones so well placed that the wind cannot enter. On the seaward side, there is a drop below the wall into the sea.\n\nThe castle itself consists of one huge drum tower crowned with formidable battlements; so large that it can comfortably contain stables, barracks, armory and lord's chambers in the same structure. Although never taken in battle, Storm's End has endured several sieges and battles in recent history. The last Storm King, Argilac the Arrogant, abandoned his impressive defenses to meet the Targaryen commander, Orys Baratheon, in open battle during Aegon Targaryen's War of Conquest, and lost. This led to Orys Baratheon marrying Argilac's daughter and becoming Lord of Storm's End.\n\nDuring the War of the Usurper, Storm's End was besieged for a year by the host of Lord Mace Tyrell, who commanded the landward forces, while Paxter Redwyne's fleet of the Arbor kept the castle cut off by sea. Stannis Baratheon, commanding the defense, refused to yield and his men were reduced to eating rats. A smuggler named Davos ran the blockade to resupply the castle and Stannis rewarded him by knighting him and giving him lands, thus founding House Seaworth, but he also cut off the fingertips of his left hand as punishment for all his previous smuggling. After the war, Stannis was furious when his brother Robert, now king, gave the castle to their younger brother Renly and placed Stannis in command of Dragonstone. This led to many years of bitterness on Stannis' part.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, Storm's End supported Renly when he treacherously attempted to usurp the crown, and was besieged by Stannis. When the castellan, Cortnay Penrose, refused to yield even after Renly's death, he was killed by Stannis' ally, the priestess Melisandre, and the castle surrendered. Later, the castle was besieged by a strong army under Mace Tyrell, but he abandoned the siege after a few weeks to return to King's Landing after the arrest of his daughter Margaery by the High Septon. As of \"A Dance with Dragons\", the castle remains in the hands of Stannis Baratheon.\n\nAt the end of \"A Dance with Dragons\" an army lands in the Stormlands led by Jon Connington and a young man claiming to be Aegon Targaryen, the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell and heir to the Iron Throne. To attract support, Aegon plans to conquer Stormâs End and raise the banner of House Targaryen above the battlements.\n\nIn the TV adaptation, scenes in the Stormlands were filmed in Larrybane, Northern Ireland. The scene where Stannis' red priestess Melisandre gave birth to a shadow creature was filmed in the Cushendun Caves, also in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Crownlands are the lands in Westeros surrounding King's Landing, ruled directly by the crown of the Iron Throne. The Targaryen kings consolidated this as one of the nine regions of Westeros, after their conquest of the Seven Kingdoms, from sparsely populated pieces of the surrounding kingdoms of the Riverlands and Stormlands. The Crownlands form the entire coastline of Blackwater Bay, and include the original Targaryen homeland on the island of Dragonstone, at the Narrow Sea entrance to Blackwater Bay. Besides King's Landing, which is the largest city in Westeros, the Crownlands include many towns and castles. The illegitimate children born in the Crownlands are given the surname Waters.\n\nDragonstone was once the westernmost outpost of the ancient Freehold of Valyria. A century before the Doom, the Targaryen family was sent to Dragonstone to rule there. When the Doom came upon Valyria, House Targaryen survived along with the last of the Valyrian dragons. Another century later, Aegon Targaryen and his sisters Rhaenys and Visenya launched a massive campaign of conquest from the island and eventually conquered all of Westeros except for Dorne, and North of the Wall. Aegon's progeny would reign as kings of the Seven Kingdoms for centuries.\n\nDragonstone is a massive, forbidding fortress, taking up a large portion of the island of the same name. The castle is unique in that the builders and sorcerers of Valyria carved its towers and keeps into the shapes of dragons and made ferocious gargoyles to cover its walls using both magic and masonry. The castle's lower levels are warm due to residual volcanic activity deep below the keep. There is a small port and town outside of the castle.\n\nDuring the War of the Usurper, before the sack of King's Landing, the Targaryen Queen Rhaella, who was pregnant, and her son Viserys were sent to Dragonstone along with part of the Targaryen fleet and a garrison of loyal soldiers. But after King's Landing fell, Robert Baratheon dispatched his brother Stannis to take the island stronghold. After a storm destroyed the royalist fleet, the Targaryen garrison tried to betray Viserys and his newborn sister, Daenerys, to Stannis (the queen had died in childbirth). But Targaryen loyalists led by Ser Willem Darry took the children away. Stannis conquered Dragonstone easily, and King Robert granted him ownership of the castle, which Stannis took as a slight, because his younger brother Renly then inherited Storm's End, the ancient seat of House Baratheon. Ser Axell Florent, one of the uncles of Stannis' wife Selyse Florent, acted as castellan.\n\nUpon Robert's death, Stannis declared himself King of Westeros, condemning the Queen's children as bastards born of incest as he had discovered with Jon Arryn. Dragonstone became his main seat; he returned there after the disastrous Battle of the Blackwater. His councilor, the red priestess Melisandre of Asshai, tried to convince him to let her raise the \"stone dragon\" of the castle through blood magic, but Lord Davos Seaworth convinced Stannis to go north to the Wall to help the Night's Watch instead. After Stannis abandoned Dragonstone, leaving the Bastard of Nightsong Rolland Storm as castellan, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister dispatched a fleet to barricade it. However, Ser Loras Tyrell, impatient to free the fleet to protect his home castle of Highgarden, attacked Dragonstone directly. He took the castle but lost a thousand men and was himself reportedly gravely wounded. As of \"A Dance with Dragons\", Dragonstone is now controlled by troops loyal to House Tyrell, and theoretically, once again under control of the Iron Throne.\n\nOne scene set at Dragonstone, in which Stannis burns wooden sculptures of the Seven gods, was filmed at the beach of Downhill Strand.\n\nKing's Landing is the royal capital of Westeros and the Seven Kingdoms. King's Landing has an estimated population of 500,000. It is situated on the Blackwater river on the spot where Aegon the Conqueror landed in Westeros to begin his conquest. The main city is surrounded by a wall, manned by a city watch nicknamed the gold cloaks, after the cloaks they wear. Within the walls, the city's natural landscape is dominated by three hills, named after Aegon and his two sisters. Poorer smallfolk (commoners) build shanty settlements outside the city. King's Landing is described as extremely populous but unsightly and dirty. The stench of the city's waste can be smelled far beyond its walls.\n\nThe royal castle, called the Red Keep, sits on Aegon's Hill. It is the seat of the royal court. The Keep holds the Iron Throne. Aegon commissioned the throne's construction from the swords of his defeated enemies. According to legend, he kept the blades sharp because he believed that no ruler should ever sit comfortably. Centuries later, kings still cut themselves on the throne. It is a common belief that one who cuts himself on the throne has been \"rejected\" by the throne and is therefore not fit to rule.\n\nThe city also holds the Great Sept of Baelor, where the Most Devout convene with the High Septon. It is the holiest sept of the Seven. The slums of King's Landing are called Flea Bottom, where residents are so poor they regularly subsist on \"bowls of brown\", a mystery stew that can include the meat of puppies and murder victims.\n\nMartin compared King's Landing to medieval Paris or London. It was inspired by the view of Staten Island from his childhood home in Bayonne, New Jersey.\n\nThe first season of the TV adaptation used Malta's former capital Mdina to represent King's Landing. \"Like King's Landing, Mdina is a walled medieval city built upon a hill, but unlike King's Landing, Mdina is an inland cityâso the production was limited to interior shots such as side streets and the town gate, which can be seen when Ned Stark arrives. Nearby Fort Manoel doubled as the great Sept of Baelor,\" which can be seen when Ned Stark is executed. Various other locations around Malta represent the Red Keep, \"including the real-life residence of the president of Malta, San Anton Palace. The gates of Fort Ricasoli doubled as the Red Keep's gates; Fort St. Angelo was used for the scenes of Arya Stark chasing cats; and St. Dominic monastery stood in for the scene where Ned Stark confronts Cersei Lannister in the godswood.\"\n\n\"In season two, filming for King's Landing and the Red Keep shifted from Malta to the historic parts of Dubrovnik and the MinÄeta, Bokar, and Lovrijenac fortresses in Croatia, which allowed for more exterior shots of an authentic walled medieval city.\" Parts of Season three were filmed there, too, as well as in nearby Trsteno. \"Known as \"the Pearl of the Adriatic\", the city proved to share many characteristics with the fictional capital: it had a well-preserved medieval look, with high walls and the sea at its side. According to David Benioff, executive producer of the show, \"King's Landing might be the single most important location in the entire show, and it has to look right\", and \"The minute we started walking around the city walls we knew that was it. You read the descriptions in the book and you come to Dubrovnik and that's what the actual city is. It has the sparkling sea, sun and beautiful architecture.\" Co-Executive Producer D.B. Weiss added \"To find a full-on, immaculately preserved medieval walled city that actually looks uncannily like King's Landing where the bulk of our show is set, that was in and of itself such an amazing find\". The Tourney of the Hand in season 1 was filmed in Shane's Castle, Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Red Keep interior are filmed at Belfast's studio The Paint Hall. Set designer Gemma Jackson said, \"When I was thinking about King's Landing, the whole red aspect of it, that immediately made me think of Rajasthan. The floor [at King's Landing] was from the Pantheon in Rome.\" Martin said that \"Our throne room is a spectacular throne room â we actually redressed a throne room built for [another] film. And again, it occupied a quarter of the Paint Hall, so it's very big, but in my mind [in the books], it's Westminster Abbey, it's St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nDorne is the southernmost and least populated land of Westeros. The capital, Sunspear, is the seat of the ruling House Martell. As of the first five books, Doran Nymeros Martell is the Prince of Dorne and Lord of Sunspear. Doran's sister, Princess Elia, was married in a political alliance to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne. They had two children, a daughter, Rhaenys and a son, Aegon. During the Sack of King's Landing at the end of Robert's Rebellion, Princess Elia was raped and murdered by Gregor Clegane, a House Lannister bannerman (vassal). Her children were also killed in front of her. Prince Doran and his wife, Princess Mellaria, have three children, Arianne, Quentyn and Trystane. During the War of the Five Kings, Tyrion Lannister, as Hand of the King, turns the historical enmity of House Martell and Dorne into an alliance by sending King Joffrey's middle sibling and sister, Myrcella Baratheon, as the betrothed future bride to Trystane, the youngest child of Prince Doran, who is about her own age. The eldest child of Prince Doran, Arianne, is heir to House Martell, Sunspear and the rule of Dorne. The wealth of Dorne comes from their famous Sand Steeds, purebred horses of endurance, speed and grace, and from spices, wines, fishing, fabrics and textiles.\n\nDorne is bordered by the Sea of Dorne to the north, the islands known as the Stepstones to the east, and stretches from the high mountains of the Dornish marches, the Red Mountains, separating Dorne from the remainder of the Seven Kingdoms by land. The two major passes though the Red Mountains that connect Dorne with the rest of the continent are the Stone Way Pass and the Prince's Pass. The Princeâs Pass leads to the Reach, while the Stone Way exits the mountains near Summerhall. The southern coast of the continent is bordered by the Summer Sea. It is the hottest kingdom in Westeros and the region is rocky, mountainous, arid and dry, featuring the only desert on the continent. Its rivers provide some fertile lands and even during a long summer there is enough rain and other supplies of water to keep Dorne habitable. Inland water is almost as valuable as gold, and wells are jealously guarded. Notable locations of Dorne are Starfall, the seat of House Dayne, and Yronwood, the seat of House Yronwood, the most powerful of the Martell bannermen. Planky Town is a trade port town at the mouth of the River Greenblood.\n\nDornishmen have a reputation for hot-bloodedness. They differ both culturally and ethnically from other Westerosi due to the historical mass immigration of Rhoynish people. They have adopted many Rhoynish customs as well, including equal primogeniture. Dorne was the only kingdom in Westeros to successfully resist Aegon's conquest, even killing one of his dragons during the war. It was conquered by Daeron I over a century after the Targaryen invasion, but rose against him leading to his death. Finally under Daeron's cousin Daeron II they joined through marriage. This accomplishment has allowed Dorne to retain a measure of independence. Lords of the ruling House Martell still style themselves \"Prince\" and \"Princess\" in the Rhoynish fashion. Unlike most of the rest of Westeros, illegitimate children born in Dorne are treated nearly the same as legal offspring and given the surname Sand, as with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins.\n\nMartin said \"You don't get the real tropical stuff til you get down south to Dorne.\"\n\nAccording to \"A Storm of Swords\", \"There were three sorts of Dornishmen [...]. There were the salty Dornishmen who lived along the coasts, the sandy Dornishmen of the deserts and long river valleys, and the stony Dornishmen who made their fastnesses in the passes and heights of the Red Mountains. The salty Dornishmen had the most Rhoynish blood, the stony Dornishmen the least. All three sorts seemed well represented in Doranâs retinue. The salty Dornishmen were lithe and dark, with smooth olive skin and long black hair streaming in the wind. The sandy Dornishmen were even darker, their faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun. They wound long bright scarfs around their helms to ward off sunstroke. The stony Dornishmen were biggest and fairest, sons of the Andals and the First Men, brownhaired or blond, with faces that freckled or burned in the sun instead of browning.\"\n\nIn the show, Dornish scenes were filmed in the Alcazar de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.\n\nAcross the narrow sea on the western side of Essos lie the nine Free Cities, independent city-states that are mostly on islands or along the coast. They are Lys, Myr, Pentos, Braavos, Lorath, Norvos, Qohor, Volantis and Tyrosh. Although most Free Cities are named early in the first novel, the books only provide a map of this region in \"A Dance with Dragons\". Mountains to the east separate the coast from the plains of the Dothraki Sea, though gaps in the mountain range provide the Dothraki people some access to the Free Cities. The Free Cities were colonies built by the ancient Valyrian Freehold, and later declared independence after the Doom of Valyria. An exception to this is Braavos, which was founded by refugees fleeing Valyrian expansion, escaped slaves and other rabble. The languages of the Free Cities are derivatives of High Valyrian.\n\nThe Free Cities span an area characterized by the river Rhoyne, which the local character Yandry describes as \"the greatest river in the world\". Its banks are the homeland of the Rhoynar, who worship the river as \"Mother Rhoyne\". As mapped in \"A Dance with Dragons\", the Rhoyne originates from the conjunction of two of its tributaries, the Upper Rhoyne and the Little Rhoyne, southeast of the ruins of Ghoyan Drohe. The headwaters of the Upper Rhoyne lie in Andalos, the homeland of the Andals between Braavos and Pentos. The Rhoyne's course runs southeast to turn due south after Dagger Lake, where river pirates hide on and around the many lake islands. The Rhoyne gains in width considerably as it gets fed by more tributaries, until it opens into the Summer Sea in a delta near the Free City of Volantis.\n\nUnique among the Free Cities, Braavos was not a Valyrian colony, but a secret refuge from Valyrian expansion. It is a city spread over hundreds of tiny islands, which are located in a lagoon on the northwestern end of Essos where the Narrow Sea and Shivering Sea meet. Braavos is known for its swashbuckling bravos and its mysterious assassins, the Faceless Men. It is also famed for the Titan of Braavos, both a fortress and a statue. The ruler of Braavos is known as the Sealord and it is from the sea that the city's power and wealth flows. The hulls of Braavosi ships are painted purple and their merchant ships sail to many distant lands and bring their trade and wealth back home. Braavos has many moneylenders and the Iron Bank of Braavos lends money to foreign nations, including the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nBraavosi dress in flashy colors while the very rich and powerful dress in black and in blues that are almost black. Officials of Braavos, called keyholders and justiciars, wear drab coats of brown or grey. The city is also renowned worldwide for its courtesans. Every courtesan has her own barge and servants to work them. The beauty of famed courtesans has inspired many a song. They are showered with gifts from goldsmiths and craftsmen beg for their custom. Nobility and rich merchants pay the courtesans large amounts of money to appear alongside them at events, and bravos are known to kill each other in their names. The character Syrio Forel, former first sword of the Sealord of Braavos, introduces Arya Stark to a unique form of Braavosi sword fighting, called Water Dancing. The style is a refined form of fencing in which the practitioner stands sideways and wields a slender blade. Pugnacious bravos fill the city, frequently dueling to display their skill.\n\nBraavos was inspired by Venice, Italy. It was filmed in Croatian towns of Å ibenik, and KaÅ¡tel Gomilica in the TV series.\n\nPentos is a major trading port on a bay of the western coast. Dominated by an architecture of square brick towers, it is headed by a Prince who is chosen by the de facto rulers of the city, known as Magisters. Khalasars occasionally make their way this far from the Dothraki Sea, but the Pentoshi are spared much of the raiding and invasions by paying tribute to their khals. Men from Pentos wear dyed and forked beards. As in many Free Cities, slavery is outlawed, but the wealthy and powerful members of the city have the ability to flout these laws by keeping servants collared in bronze.\n\nDaenerys's scenes in the pilot episode were filmed in Morocco. The television adaptation re-used the Jerusalem sets of \"Kingdom of Heaven\" near Ouarzazate, Morocco. \"One small portion of the Jerusalem set, redressed and repainted, became the courtyard of Illyrio's manse where Dany first meets Khal Drogo.\" \"When the pilot was delivered, HBO asked for extensive reshoots, including the scrapping of all the footage shot in a landlocked part of Morocco â which was supposed to take place in Pentos, a fictional port city â and filming it again in Malta.\" The exterior scenes at Illyrio's mansion in Pentos were shot at Verdala Palace, the 16th century summer palace of the president of Malta. \"One of Malta's most spectacular natural attractions, the Azure Window on the island of Gozo, stood in for the location of Daenerys Targaryen's wedding to Khal Drogo.\"\n\nWhen Pentos reappeared in Season 5, it was filmed in Croatia.\n\nVolantis is a port on the southern coast of Essos, and is the oldest and proudest of the Free Cities. A fortification known as the Black Wall protects the oldest parts of the city. The city is ruled by three triarchs, who are elected every year by free landholders of Volantis, and defended by slave soldiers called the \"Tiger cloaks\". Volantis is incredibly important to the slave market, and in the city there are five slaves to every free man. All Volantene slaves have facial tattoos denoting their profession: for instance, sex slaves have tears tattooed on their faces, and the tiger cloaks have tiger stripes. The worship of R'hllor is the most influential religion of Volantis, especially among slaves.\n\nThe TV adaptation used locations in CÃ³rdoba, Spain.\n\n\nThis section covers the Essos locations east of the Free Cities that Daenerys Targeryen passes through on her travels in \"A Game of Thrones\" and \"A Clash of Kings\" before moving on to Slaver's Bay.\n\nValyria is a peninsula in Eastern Essos, west of Slaver's Bay. Before the Doom of Valyria, it was the seat of the Valyrian Freehold, a massive empire thousands of years old. The Valyrians are characterized by their silver hair and violet eyes. Valyria was called The Freehold because every man who owned land was allowed to vote for their leaders. The Valyrians also used slaves to mine the Fourteen Flames, a series of volcanoes rich with ore. They subjugated the Ghiscari and the Rhoynar and established all of the Free Cities, save Braavos. They did this through their knowledge of dragonlore. Many Valyrians rode dragons. However, hundred of years ago, an event known as the Doom of Valyria destroyed the Freehold and made Valyria an archipelago. The Targaryens are of the blood of old Valyria, who escaped before The Doom.\n\nThe Dothraki Sea is a vast, flat grassland on Essos. It is inhabited by the Dothraki people, a copper-skinned race of warlike nomads with their own language and unique culture. The Dothraki live in hordes called khalasars, each led by a chief called a khal. Khalasars are broken into groups, called khas, which are each led by one of the khal's captains, called kos. Dothraki are expert riders and their horses are of prime importance in their culture, used for food, transportation, raw materials, warfare, and establishing social standing. They regularly raid other peoples.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin said \"The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures... Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also Alans, Sioux, Cheyenne, and various other Amerindian tribes... seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy. So any resemblance to Arabs or Turks is coincidental. Well, except to the extent that the [historic] Turks were also originally horsemen of the steppes, not unlike the Alans, Huns, and the rest.\" However, he also noted that \"In general, though, while I do draw inspiration from history, I try to avoid direct one-for-one transplants, [so] it would not be correct to say that the Dothraki are Mongols.\"\n\nThe Dothraki have only one permanent city, called Vaes Dothrak, which serves as their capital. The city is filled with statues stolen from other cities the Dothraki conquered or raided. There is a law that no Dothraki may shed blood within the boundaries of Vaes Dothrak and that those who do are cursed. Two gigantic bronze stallions, whose hooves meet midair, form an arch above the entryway to the city. For the first season of the TV adaptation, Sandy Brae in the Mourne Mountains of Northern Ireland was chosen to stand in for Vaes Dothrak; the bronze stallions making up the Horse Gate as the main entrance of Vaes Dothrak were later C.G.I.ed on two pedestals erected on location.\n\nLhazar is an area of the semi-arid lands south of the Dothraki Sea. A region of pastures and hills, it is inhabited by the Lhazareen, a peaceful people with bronze skin, flat faces, and almond eyes. They are predominantly shepherds, called the Lamb Men by the Dothraki, who frequently prey on them. They worship a god called the Great Shepherd and believe that all of humanity is part of a single flock. The scenes at the village of the Lamb Men that is sacked by the Dothraki were filmed in Malta, at the farming town of Manikata.\n\nSlaver's Bay is a marginal sea of the Summer Sea, lying to the south of the Dothraki Sea, to the west of Lhazar and thousands of leagues to the east of the Free Cities. The weather is very hot there. After a first mention in \"A Game of Thrones\" in relation to slavery, Daenerys Targaryen conquers the three great Slaver's Bay port city-states Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen in \"A Storm of Swords\". She stays in Meereen throughout most of \"A Dance with Dragons\".\n\nThe cities were built from the rubble of Old Ghis, an ancient rival of Valyria that was crushed by that nation thousands of years before the series' events. The economies of the cities are largely based on slave labor and the slave trade. Treatment of slaves is often harsh, while citizens live in relative luxury. Professional soldiers of all three cities wear outlandish costumes and hairstyles that limit their usefulness in battle. The cities' militaries are highly dependent on additional slave and mercenary armies for the actual fighting.\n\nPresent inhabitants of the bay are a mixed race that no longer speak the old Ghiscari tongue but variations of High Valyrian with a characteristic growl. The ancient folk of Ghis, who name themselves the harpy's sons in Astapor, are said to have bristly red-black hair. The Good Masters of Astapor all appear alike to Daenerys as \"thick fleshy men with amber skin, broad noses, dark eyes. Their wiry hair was black or a dark red, or that queer mixture of red and black that was peculiar to Ghiscari\". Only the freeborn men of Astapor are permitted to wear garments called tokars, whose fringes display their status. Many Astapori women veil their face for the dust. The Astapori are drenched in sweet perfumes.\n\nAstapor lies on the banks of the Worm River, a wide, slow and crooked stream with wooded islands. Entering Astapor at the beginning of \"A Storm of Swords\", Daenerys experiences it as an ancient and dilapidated city that has long passed its glory days. The city is dominated by its red brick architecture, and Arstan Whitebeard explains to Daenerys that the saying \"Brick and blood built Astapor, ... and brick and blood her people\" refers to the slaves who make the bricks. Astapor's stepped pyramids, its fighting pits, streets, the surrounding walls and the Plaza of Pride are all made of red bricks. The so-called Plaza of Punishment at Astapor's main gates is even larger than the Plaza of Pride.\n\nThe Plaza of Pride, which has a red-brick fountain and a huge bronze harpy statue in its center, serves as an open air slave market and a marshaling area for the Unsullied, elite eunuch spearmen with a renown for discipline and effectiveness. Astapor is the only city to sell Unsullied, but also sells bed slaves, fieldhands, scribes, craftsmen and tutors. The Unsullied require a huge investment in both time and money by the Astapori who raise and train them, but they earn the most profitable of returns for the Good Masters of Astapor. The Unsullied wear spiked bronze hats, and they obey at all costs, even if it demands their death. They are given new slave names each day to be reminded of their worthlessness. In times of attack, unsold Unsullied are deployed to the massive, crumbling red-brick walls that the Astapori no longer man.\n\nDaenerys decides to buy all of Astapor's trained and untrained Unsullied, over 8600 in number, and tells them to kill all adult Astapori slavers and soldiers when she leaves the city. She gives the power over Astapor to a council of former slaves led by a healer, a scholar and a priest, and tens of thousands of former slaves join her on her travels to Yunkai. A former butcher named Cleon fends off a scheme to have the Good Masters re-established, and was crowned as the King of Astapor in reward.\n\nThe TV show used the coastal town of Essaouira, Morocco to film scenes in Astapor.\n\nThe smallest of the three cities, Yunkai, like Meereen, does not trade in Unsullied but is known for its fighting pits and its pleasure houses, both of which turn out slaves at a brisk pace. The city is similar to Astapor in architecture except for its smaller size and its use of yellow brick in its buildings instead of red. The slavers of Yunkai are known as the Wise Masters. Because of the city's lack of Unsullied, it relies on a mixed professional and slave army of approximately 4,000 with at least 1,000 mercenaries. Typical for Ghiscari, Yunkai soldiers wear impractical armor and oiled hair teased into enormous shapes, limiting their effectiveness.\n\nYunkish scenes were filmed in AÃ¯t Benhaddou, Morocco in the TV show.\n\nThe largest of the three slaver cities, Meereen has a population equaling that of Astapor and Yunkai combined. The city has architecture similar to that of its neighbors, but it is made of bricks of many colors. Its landscape is dominated by a massive pyramid, named the Great Pyramid, and the Temple of Graces, which is capped by a golden dome. Meereen is unique among the Ghiscari cities in that it is filled with many temples and pyramids. The slavers of Meereen are known as the Great Masters. They field a force of lancers equipped in traditionally extravagant Ghiscari fashion with scales of copper and lances as long as fourteen feet. It is built on the banks of the river Skahadhazan.\n\nMany of the scenes in Meereen were filmed in the Split and the Fortress of Klis, Croatia. In Season 5, Daznak's Pit in the city was shot in the Plaza de Toros in Osuna, Spain.\n\nEast of Naath, the Basilisk Isles have been a festering sore of the Summer Sea, and a safe haven for pirates, slavers, sellswords, and outlaws. Ruins have been found on the Isle of Tears, the Isle of Toads, and Ax Island. The Isle of Tears is the largest island, with steep valleys and black bogs. It was conquered by the Ghiscari and it was called Gorgai for two centuries, until the dragonlords of Valyria captured it and renamed it Gorgossos. It was used as a prison by the Freehold, a place where they sent their most despicable criminals.\n\nAs indicated on a map in \"A Storm of Swords\", the Summer Islands are situated to the south of Westeros, with a local fauna of talking birds, apes, and monkeys. The novels describe the island natives as dark-skinned people who speak their own language. They wear colored feathery clothes and live on fruit and fish. From their port city named Tall Trees Town, the Summer Isles export rare goods to Westeros such as wine, spices, feathers, but also a special kind of wood from which bows are made that have a longer range than most others. People of the Seven Kingdoms call the Summer Islanders' great vessels \"swan ships\", \"for their billowing white sails and for their figureheads, most of which depicted birds\". Samwell Tarly, who spends two chapters in \"A Feast for Crows\" aboard a swan ship, describes the Summer Islander women as wanton, and their gods as strange; they \"revered the elderly and celebrated their dead\" through sexual intercourse. As a prostitute explains to Tyrion in \"A Clash of Kings\", the Summer Islanders regard their sexuality as the gods' gift to worship them through mating, and hence many of their highborn youths and maidens serve in pleasure houses for a few years to honor the gods.\n\nThe Red Waste is a great desert-like area in the eastern part of Essos. Not much is known about it, since it was only briefly seen in \"A Clash of Kings\" when Daenerys Targaryen and her \"khalasar\" crossed it. The only known settlement in the region, Vaes Tolorro, is in ruins.\n\nFirst mentioned in \"A Game of Thrones\", the city of Qarth has not yet appeared on any maps in the books. However, the HBO Viewer Guide world map and the opening titles of the TV series' second season show Qarth located at a strait between the Summer Sea and the Jade Sea in the south-east of Essos. Upon Daenerys' first visit to Qarth in \"A Clash of Kings\", the warlock Pyat Pree describes his city as the center of the world and as a gateway of commerce and culture between the east and west, and the north and south. The reader learns through Daenerys's eyes that the city is surrounded by three graded walls of thirty to fifty feet in height, respectively engraved with portraits of animals, war, and lovemaking. The city's buildings are of many different colors, including rose, violet, and umber. Slender towers rise throughout the city, fountains adorn every square, and thousands of colored birds, blooming trees and flowers fill the city. The TV adaptation filmed Qarth on the island of Lokrum near Dubrovnik and constructed a set at the Dubac quarry in Croatia to double for the gates of Qarth.\n\nThe Qartheen are described as \"tall pale folk in linen and samite and tiger fur\", with the women wearing gowns that leave one breast bare, while the men sport beaded silk skirts. Daenerys perceives them as \"nothing if not polite\". Slaves serve their needs. The Pureborn, descendants of the city's ancient kings and queens, govern Qarth and also command the city's defenses. Three principal merchant groups battle amongst themselves and against the Pureborn for dominance of the city: the Thirteen, the Ancient Guild of Spicers, and the Tourmaline Brotherhood. Qarth's warlocks, whose lips are turned blue from a potion called \"the shade of the evening\", are said to brood over these factions; they are still feared although their power and prestige have waned over the years. Qarth is also home to the Sorrowful Men, a guild of assassins named so for whispering \"I am so sorry,\" before killing their victims. Daenerys leaves Qarth again at the end of \"A Clash of Kings\".\n\nAsshai and the Shadow Lands are mysterious locations in the \"Ice and Fire\" world. They are first mentioned in \"A Game of Thrones\" and were first mapped in \"The Lands of Ice and Fire\", lying on the far east of the known world. Martin is unsure if the books will ever take the readers to Asshai, but said that readers may learn more through the POV character Melisandre (who originates from Asshai) or through the memories and mentions of other characters. Jorah Mormont describes Asshai as a port city far to the south of the Dothraki sea, at the end of the known world. Asshai exports such goods as black amethysts, amber and dragonglass. At another time, Jorah Mormont tells Daenerys of great kingdoms to the east of the Red Waste, and lists Asshai by the Shadow as one of the cities full of wonders there. According to Martin, all ship travels between Westeros and Asshai go via the Summer Sea and the Jade Sea through the straits at Qarth, and that the common folk still believe the world to be flat. However, according to Martin, \"Asshai is not nearly important to trade as Yi Ti, and the rich port cities of Yi Ti (and Leng) and more easily reached via Qarth.\" Quaithe of the Shadow prophesies Daenerys in Qarth that \"To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east [...] and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.\" When Daenerys interprets this to mean she must go to Asshai, Quaithe says she would find the truth there.\n\nThere are many tales about the Shadow Lands, though how much truth they hold is unclear. The Dothraki believe that ghost grass covers the Shadow Lands, with stalks that glow in the dark and grow taller than a man on horseback. Daenerys heard that \"spellsingers, warlocks, and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night\". There are also Westerosi maesters in Asshai. The mages of Asshai teach others their healing powers, but also their spells requiring blood sacrifice. Ancient books of Asshai record the Azor Ahai prophecy followed by members of the R'hllor faith. Daenerys heard that dragons themselves originated from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea, and they possibly still live there. Bran dreams of flying Dragons in Asshai. The petrified dragon eggs Illyrio gives to Daenerys are said to come from the Shadow Lands. The \"dour and frightening\" Shadow Men cover their bodies in tattoos and wear lacquered wooden masks, and the appearance of the Asshai'i is described as dark and solemn. The Dothraki believe the Asshai'i to be the spawn of shadows. The Asshai'i have a language of their own.\n\nIbben is a collection of islands located above Essos in the Bay of Whales. The largest of these islands is Ib, which contains the cities Port of Ibben and Ib Nor. Until the Doom of Valyria, Ibben was ruled by a God-King. Now power is held by the Shadow Council, which is made up of nobles, priest, and wealthy guildsmen. Ibben is first mentioned in \"A Game of Thrones\", where Tyrion talks of rumors that mammoths \"roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben\". In 2002, Martin said the narrative would \"probably not\" take readers to Ibben, which he described as a \"cold, mountainous, Iceland-sized island\" (i.e. 40,000 square miles) in the Shivering Sea, with the Port of Ibben as the major city; some Ibbenese also live on smaller islands nearby or in colonies on Essos. Ibben is unmapped in the books as of \"A Dance with Dragons\", but similar to Martin's descriptions, the HBO Viewer Guide world map gives the island's location as to the north-east of Essos. Martin said that due to a large whale population in the Shivering sea, many of the Ibbenses were whalers. The Ibbenses are known to chew whale blubber in order to maintain their metabolism in the cold climate. Several characters see Ibbenese whalers and cogs at the ports of King's Landing, Braavos, Maidenpool, Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, and the Iron Islands. The novels describe the people of Ibben as squat and hairy; Arya even meets an Ibbenese woman with a mustache. Tyrion and Varys meet foul-smelling Ibbenese, who \"were as fond of axes as they were of each other\". Arya sees \"a dark brutal axeman from Ib\" in her dreams. The Ibbenese are said to speak with low, raspy voices and to have their own language.\n\nThe novels repeatedly describe Yi Ti as a city full of wonders, lying in the far east. As of \"A Dance with Dragons\", Yi Ti has not appeared on any maps in the books, but Martin specified that \"Yi Ti is to the south east of Qarth, generally, across the Jade Sea.\" The city is first mentioned in \"A Game of Thrones\", talking of rumors that \"basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti\". Sailor stories presented in \"A Feast for Crows\" mention that a grey plague has hit Yi Ti. The god of the people of Yi Ti is called the Lion of Night. Daenerys sees people of Yi Ti as bright-eyed men in monkey-tail hats in the markets of Vaes Dothrak. Martin is unsure \"to what extent those peoples [like of Yi Ti] will ever enter this present story, however... their lands are very far away.\"\n\nNorth of Yi Ti, the Plain of Jogos Nhai are windswept, with rolling hills. They are dominated by a race of mounted warriors called the Jogos Nhai. The Jogos Nhai live in Yurts and tents, and are a nomadic people. They are short, squat, and have large heads and small faces. Men and women both have pointed skulls, a result of their custom of binding the heads of newborns. They also ride zorses, a mount that can withstand much more than average horse. They are striped. The Jogos Nhai do not fight between themselves, and live in small clans bound by blood. They live in a state of perpetual war with outsiders. Each tribe is commanded by a \"jhat\", or war chief, and a moonsinger, who is a priestess, healer, and judge. Moonsingers are generally female, and \"jhats\" are mostly male. (Paraphrased from, \"The World of Ice and Fire)\"\n\nSothoryos (or Sothoros as it is spelled in the novels) is the third continent in Planetos (the unofficial name for the planet that A Song of Ice and Fire takes place in). Sothoros is large, plague ridden, covered in jungles and largely unexplored. It is described as a \"land without end\" by Jaenara Belaerys, a Valyrian dragonlord from before the Doom of Valyria.\n\nIt is inhabited by a race of men described as brindle-skinned half-men by Daenerys Targaryen.\n\n\n", "id": "12302", "title": "World of A Song of Ice and Fire"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12304", "text": "Grandmaster (chess)\n\nThe title Grandmaster is awarded to chess players by the world chess organization FIDE. Apart from World Champion, Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain.\n\nOnce achieved, the title is held for life. In chess literature it is usually abbreviated to GM. (Other titles are also often abbreviated: FM for FIDE Master, IM for International Master, and CM for Candidate Master.) The abbreviation IGM for International Grandmaster is also sometimes used, particularly in older literature.\n\nGrandmaster, International Master, and FIDE Master are open to both men and women. A number of women have earned the GM title, with the first two having been Nona Gaprindashvili in 1978 and Susan Polgar in 1991. Since about 2000, most of the top 10 women have held the GM title.\n\nA separate gender-segregated title, Woman Grandmaster (WGM), is also available. It is awarded to women who attain a level of skill between that of a FIDE Master and an International Master.\n\nFIDE awards separate Grandmaster titles to composers and solvers of chess problems (see List of grandmasters for chess composition). The International Correspondence Chess Federation (ICCF) awards the title of International Correspondence Chess Grandmaster (ICCGM).\n\nThe first known use of the term \"grandmaster\" in connection with chess was in an 1838 issue of \"Bell's Life\", in which a correspondent referred to William Lewis as \"our past grandmaster\". Lewis himself later referred to Philidor as a grandmaster, and the term was also applied to a few other players.\n\nIn the Ostend tournament of 1907 the term \"grandmaster\" (\"GroÃmeister\" in German) was used. The tournament was divided into two sections: the Championship Tournament and the Masters' Tournament. The Championship section was for players who had previously won an international tournament. Siegbert Tarrasch won the Championship section, over Carl Schlechter, Dawid Janowski, Frank Marshall, Amos Burn, and Mikhail Chigorin. These players were described as grandmasters for the purposes of the tournament.\n\nThe San SebastiÃ¡n 1912 tournament won by Akiba Rubinstein was a designated grandmaster event. Rubinstein won with 12Â½ points out of 19. Tied for second with 12 points were Aron Nimzowitsch and Rudolf Spielmann.\n\nBy some accounts, in the St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament, the title \"Grandmaster\" was formally conferred by Russian Tsar Nicholas II, who had partially funded the tournament. The Tsar reportedly awarded the title to the five finalists: Emanuel Lasker, JosÃ© RaÃºl Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine, Siegbert Tarrasch, and Frank Marshall. Chess historian Edward Winter has questioned this, stating that the earliest known sources that support this story are an article by Robert Lewis Taylor in the June 15, 1940, issue of \"The New Yorker\" and Marshall's autobiography \"My 50 Years of Chess\" (1942).\n\nBefore 1950, the term \"grandmaster\" was sometimes informally applied to other world class players. The \"FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale des Ãchecs\" (FIDE, or World Chess Federation) was formed in Paris in 1924, but at that time did not formulate criteria on who should earn the title.\n\nIn 1927, the Soviet Union's Chess Federation established the title of \"Grandmaster of the Soviet Union\", for their own players, since at that time Soviets were not competing outside their own country. This title was abolished in 1931, after having been awarded to Boris Verlinsky, who won the 1929 Soviet Championship. The title was brought back in 1935, and awarded to Mikhail Botvinnik, who thus became the first \"official\" Grandmaster of the USSR. Verlinsky did not get his title back.\n\nWhen FIDE reorganized after World War II it adopted regulations concerning the award of international titles. Titles were awarded by a resolution of the FIDE General Assembly and the Qualification Committee. FIDE first awarded the Grandmaster title in 1950 to 27 players. These players were:\n\n\nSince FIDE did not award the Grandmaster title posthumously, world-class players who died prior to 1950, including World Champions Steinitz, Lasker, Capablanca, and Alekhine, never received the title.\n\nTitle awards under the original regulations were subject to political concerns. Efim Bogoljubov, who had emigrated from the Soviet Union to Germany, was not entered in the first class of Grandmasters, even though he had played two matches for the World Championship with Alekhine. He received the title in 1951, by a vote of thirteen to eight with five abstentions. Yugoslavia supported his application, but all other Communist countries opposed it. In 1953, FIDE abolished the old regulations, although a provision was maintained that allowed older masters who had been overlooked to be awarded titles. The new regulations awarded the title of International Grandmaster of the FIDE to players meeting any of the following criteria:\n\nAfter FIDE issued the 1953 title regulations, it was recognized that they were somewhat haphazard, and work began to revise the regulations. The FIDE Congress in Vienna in 1957 adopted new regulations, called the FAV system, in recognition of the work done by International Judge Giovanni Ferrantes (Italy), Alexander (probably Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander), and Giancarlo Dal Verme (Italy). Under the 1957 regulations, the title of International Grandmaster of the FIDE was automatically awarded to:\nThe regulations also allowed titles to be awarded by a FIDE Congress on recommendation by the Qualification Committee. Recommendations were based on performance in qualifying tournaments, with the required score depending on the percentage of Grandmasters and International Masters in the tournament.\n\nConcerns were raised that the 1957 regulations were too lax. At the FIDE Congress in 1961, GM Milan Vidmar said that the regulations \"made it possible to award international titles to players without sufficient merit\". At the 1964 Congress in Tel Aviv, a subcommittee was formed to propose changes to the regulations. The subcommittee recommended that the automatic award of titles be abolished, criticized the methods used for awarding titles based on qualifying performances, and called for a change in the makeup of the Qualification Committee. Several delegates supported the subcommittee recommendations, including GM Miguel Najdorf who felt that existing regulations were leading to an inflation of international titles. At the 1965 Congress in Wiesbaden FIDE raised the standards required for international titles. The International Grandmaster title regulations were:\n\nTo fulfill requirement 2b, the candidate must score one GM norm in a category 1a tournament or two norms within a three-year period in two Category 1b tournaments, or one Category 2a tournament and one Category 1b tournament.\n\nThe categories of tournaments are:\nSince FIDE titles are for life, a GM or IM does not count for the purposes of this requirement if he had not had a GM or IM result in the five years prior to the tournament.\n\nIn addition, no more than 50 percent plus one of the players can be from the same country for tournaments of 10 to 12 players, or no more than 50 percent plus two for larger tournaments.\n\nSeventy-four GM titles were awarded in 1951 through 1968. During that period, ten GM titles were awarded in 1965, but only one in 1966 and in 1968.\n\nThe modern system for awarding FIDE titles evolved from the \"Dorazil\" proposals, presented to the 1970 Siegen Chess Olympiad FIDE Congress. The proposals were put together by Dr Wilfried Dorazil (then FIDE Vice-President) and fellow Committee members Grandmaster Svetozar GligoriÄ and Professor Arpad Elo. The recommendations of the Committee report were adopted in full.\n\nIn essence, the proposals built on the work done by Professor Elo in devising his Elo rating system. The establishment of an updated list of players and their Elo rating enabled significantly strong international chess tournaments to be allocated a \"Category\", based on the average rating of the contestants. For instance, it was decided that 'Category 1' status would apply to tournaments with an average Elo rating of participants falling within the range 2251â2275; similarly Category 2 would apply to the range 2276â2300 etc. The higher the tournament Category, the stronger the tournament.\n\nAnother vital component involved the setting of meritorious \"scores\" for each Category of tournament. A player must meet or surpass the relevant score to demonstrate that they had performed at Grandmaster (GM) or International Master (IM) level. Scores were expressed as percentages of a perfect maximum score and decreased as the tournament Category increased, thereby reflecting the strength of a player's opposition and the relative difficulty of the task.\n\nTournament organisers could then apply the percentages to their own tournament format and declare in advance the actual score that participants must achieve to attain a GM or IM result (nowadays referred to as a norm).\n\nTo qualify for the Grandmaster title, a player needed to achieve three such GM results within a rolling period of three years. Exceptionally, if a player's contributory games totalled thirty or more, then the title could be awarded on the basis of two such results. There were also circumstances where the system could be adapted to fit team events and other competitions.\n\nThe full proposals included many other rules and regulations, covering such topics as:\n\n\nFrom 1977 until 2003, FIDE awarded honorary Grandmaster titles to 31 players based on their past performances or other contributions to chess. Since 2007, no distinction has been made between an \"honorary\" grandmaster and a full grandmaster. The following players have been awarded honorary Grandmaster titles:\n\n\nThe requirements for becoming a Grandmaster are somewhat complex. A player must have attained an Elo rating of at least 2500 (although they need not maintain this level to obtain or keep the title). In addition, at least two favorable results (called \"norms\") from a total of at least 27 games in tournaments involving other Grandmasters, including some from countries other than the applicant's, are usually required before FIDE will confer the title on a player. There are other milestones a player can achieve to get the title, such as winning the Women's World Championship, the World Junior Championship, or the World Senior Championship. Current regulations can be found in the FIDE Handbook.\n\nIn 1957, there were 50 GMs (USSR: 19, Yugoslavia: 7, USA: 5, Argentina: 4, West Germany: 2, France: 2, Sweden: 1, Czechoslovakia: 1, Hungary: 1, Austria: 1, Belgium: 1, Denmark: 1, Netherlands: 1, Poland: 1). In 1972, there were 88 GMs with 33 representing the USSR. The current FIDE ratings list includes over 1000 Grandmasters. Nigel Short was rated the third best player in the world in 1989 with a rating of 2650; in the 21st century such a rating would only be good enough for a player to reach the top 100 or so, with the third best player in the world usually rated around 2800. Other minor factors come into play: there are more tournaments worldwide and cheaper air travel makes them more accessible to globe-trotting chess professionals, who include many players from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe whose movements are no longer restricted as they were before the 1990s. Additionally, players can make norms in tournaments that would have been previously considered too short for norms, making norms easier to get and allowing for more norm tournaments to be held.\n\nDecember 2008 saw a record number of GMs (1,192) and IMs (2,916), causing some FIDE officials to suggest that FIDE should consider an \"elite grandmaster\" title. The unofficial title \"Super Grandmaster\" is sometimes used by players to refer to those with a 2700+ rating to distinguish the most serious world champion contenders.\nThe proportion of titled players among rated players is actually becoming smaller due to the rise in the number of all chess players worldwide who have FIDE ratings. In response, one member of the FIDE Titles & Ratings Committee observed that it is now more common for weaker players to get FIDE ratings, so the comparison of Grandmasters as a proportion of all rated players is not really helpful.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n", "id": "12304", "title": "Grandmaster (chess)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12305", "text": "Gotthold Ephraim Lessing\n\nGotthold Ephraim Lessing (; 22 January 1729 â 15 February 1781) was a German writer, philosopher, dramatist, publicist and art critic, and one of the most outstanding representatives of the Enlightenment era. His plays and theoretical writings substantially influenced the development of German literature. He is widely considered by theatre historians to be the first dramaturg in his role at Abel Seyler's Hamburg National Theatre.\n\nLessing was born in Kamenz, a small town in Saxony, to Johann Gottfried Lessing and Justine Salome Feller. His father was a Lutheran minister and wrote on theology. Young Lessing studied at the Latin School in Kamenz from 1737 to 1741. With a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps, Lessing next attended the FÃ¼rstenschule St. Afra in Meissen. After completing his education at St. Afra's, he enrolled at the University of Leipzig where he pursued a degree in theology, medicine, philosophy, and philology (1746â1748).\n\nIt was here that his relationship with Karoline Neuber, a famous German actress, began. He translated several French plays for her, and his interest in theatre grew. During this time, he wrote his first play, \"The Young Scholar.\" Neuber eventually produced the play in 1748.\n\nFrom 1748 to 1760, Lessing lived in Leipzig and Berlin. He began to work as a reviewer and editor for the \"Vossische Zeitung\" and other periodicals. Lessing formed a close connection with his cousin, Christlob Mylius, and decided to follow him to Berlin. In 1750, Lessing and Mylius teamed together to begin a periodical publication named \"Beitrage zur Historie und Aufnahme des Theatres\". The publication ran only four issues, but it caught the public's eye and revealed Lessing to be a serious critic and theorist of drama.\n\nIn 1752 he took his master's degree in Wittenberg. From 1760 to 1765, he worked in Breslau (now WrocÅaw) as secretary to General Tauentzien during the Seven Years' War between Britain and France, which had effects in Europe. It was during this time that he wrote his famous \"Laokoon, or the Limitations of Poetry.\"\n\nIn 1765 Lessing returned to Berlin, leaving in 1767 to work for three years at the Hamburg National Theatre. Actor-manager, Konrad Ackermann, began construction on Germany's first permanent theatre in Hamburg. established Germany's first national theatre, the Hamburg National Theatre. The owners hired Lessing as the theatre's critic of plays and acting, which would later be known as dramaturgy (based on his own words), making Lessing the very first dramaturge. The theatre's main backer was Abel Seyler, a former currency speculator who since became known as \"the leading patron of German theatre.\" There he met Eva KÃ¶nig, his future wife. His work in Hamburg formed the basis of his pioneering work on drama, titled \"Hamburgische Dramaturgie\". Unfortunately, because of financial losses due to pirated editions of the \"Hamburgische Dramaturgie\", the Hamburg Theatre closed just three years later.\n\nIn 1770 Lessing became librarian at the ducal library, now the Herzog August Library (\"Herzog-August-Bibliothek\", \"Bibliotheca Augusta\"), in WolfenbÃ¼ttel under the commission of the Duke of Brunswick. His tenure there was energetic, if interrupted by many journeys. In 1775, for example, he accompanied Prince Leopold to Italy.\n\nOn 14 October 1771 Lessing was initiated into Freemasonry in the lodge \"Zu den drei Goldenen Rosen\" in Hamburg.\n\nIn 1776 he married Eva KÃ¶nig, who was then a widow, in Jork (near Hamburg). She died in 1778 after giving birth to a short-lived son. On 15 February 1781, Lessing, aged 52, died during a visit to the wine dealer Angott in Brunswick.\n\nLessing was also famous for his friendship with Jewish-German philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. A recent biography of Mendelssohn's grandson, Felix, describes their friendship as one of the most \"illuminating metaphors [for] the clarion call of the Enlightenment for religious tolerance\". It was this relationship that sparked his interest in popular religious debates of the time. He began publishing heated pamphlets on his beliefs which were eventually banned. It was this banishment that inspired him to return to theatre to portray his views and wrote \"Nathan the Wise\".\n\nLessing was a poet, philosopher and critic. His theoretical and critical writings are remarkable for their often witty and ironic style and their unerring polemics. Hereby the stylistic device of dialogue met with his intention of looking at a thought from different angles and searching for elements of truth even in the arguments made by his opponents. For him this truth was never solid or something which could be owned by someone but always a process of approaching.\n\nEarly in his life, Lessing showed interest in the theatre. In his theoretical and critical writings on the subjectâas in his own playsâhe tried to contribute to the development of a new type of theatre in Germany. With this he especially turned against the then predominant literary theory of Gottsched and his followers. Lessing's \"Hamburgische Dramaturgie\" ran critiques of plays that were performed in the Hamburg Theatre, but after dealing with dissatisfied actors and actresses, Lessing redirected his writings to more of an analysis on the proper uses of drama. Lessing advocated the outline of drama in Aristotle's \"Poetics\". He believed the French Academy had devalued the uses of drama through their neoclassical rules of form and separation of genres. His repeated opinions on this issue influenced theatre practitioners who began the movement of rejecting theatre rules known as \"Sturm und Drang\" (\"Storm and Stress\"). He also supported serious reception of Shakespeare's works. He worked with many theatre groups (e.g. the one of the Neuberin).\n\nIn Hamburg he tried with others to set up the German National Theatre. Today his own works appear as prototypes of the later developed bourgeois German drama. Scholars see \"Miss Sara Sampson\" and \"Emilia Galotti\" as amongst the first bourgeois tragedies, \"Minna von Barnhelm\" (Minna of Barnhelm) as the model for many classic German comedies, \"Nathan the Wise\" (\"Nathan der Weise\") as the first German drama of ideas (\"Ideendrama\"). His theoretical writings \"Laocoon\" and \"Hamburg Dramaturgy\" (\"Hamburgische Dramaturgie\") set the standards for the discussion of aesthetic and literary theoretical principles. Lessing advocated that dramaturgs should carry their work out working directly with theatre companies rather than in isolation.\n\nIn his religious and philosophical writings he defended the faithful Christian's right for freedom of thought. He argued against the belief in revelation and the holding on to a literal interpretation of the Bible by the predominant orthodox doctrine through a problem later to be called Lessing's Ditch. Lessing outlined the concept of the religious \"Proof of Power\": How can miracles continue to be used as a base for Christianity when we have no proof of miracles? Historical truths which are in doubt cannot be used to prove metaphysical truths (such as God's existence). As Lessing says it: \"That, then, is the ugly great ditch which I cannot cross, however often and however earnestly I have tried to make that leap.\"\n\nIn the final leg of his life, Lessing threw himself into an intense evaluation of theology and religion. He did much of his studying by reading manuscripts he found while working as a librarian. While working for the Duke, he formed a close friendship with a family by the name of Reimarus. The family held an unpublished manuscript that provided a complete attack on the historicity of Christian revelation. Despite discouragement from his brother, Karl, Lessing began publishing pieces of the manuscript in pamphlets known as \"Fragments from an Unnamed Author\". The controversial pamphlets resulted in a heated debate between him and another theologian, Johann Melchior Goeze. In concern for tarnishing his reputation, Goeze requested the government put an end to the feud, and Lessing was silenced through a law that took away his freedom from censorship.\n\nIn response, Lessing relied upon his skills as a playwright to write what is undoubtedly his most influential play, \"Nathan the Wise\". In the play, Lessing set up tension between Judaism, Islam, and Christianity by having one character ask Nathan which religion was the most genuine. Nathan avoids the question by telling the parable of the three rings, which implies the idea that no specific religion is the \"correct religion.\" The Enlightenment ideas to which Lessing held tight were portrayed through his \"ideal of humanity,\" stating that religion is relative to the individual's ability to reason. \"Nathan the Wise\" is considered to be the first example of the German \"literature of humanity\". \nAs a child of the Enlightenment he trusted in a \"Christianity of Reason\", which oriented itself by the spirit of religion. He believed that human reason (initiated by criticism and dissent) would develop, even without help by a divine revelation. In his writing \"The Education of Humankind\" (\"Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts\") he extensively and coherently lays out his position.\n\nThe idea of freedom (for the theatre against the dominance of its French model; for religion from the church's dogma) is his central theme throughout his life. Therefore, he also stood up for the liberation of the upcoming middle and upper class from the nobility making up their minds for them.\n\nIn his own literary existence he also constantly strove for independence. But his ideal of a possible life as a free author was hard to keep up against the economic constraints he faced. His project of authors self-publishing their works, which he tried to accomplish in Hamburg with C. J. Bode, failed.\n\nLessing is important as a literary critic for his work \"Laocoon: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry\". In this work, he argues against the tendency to take Horace's \"ut pictura poesis\" (as painting, so poetry) as prescriptive for literature. In other words, he objected to trying to write poetry using the same devices as one would in painting. Instead, poetry and painting each has its character (the former is extended in time; the latter is extended in space). This is related to Lessing's turn from French classicism to Aristotelian mimesis, discussed above.\n\nJohann Daniel MÃ¼ller (born 1716 in Wissenbach/Nassau, today part of Eschenburg, deceased after 1785) published the following anonymous book against Lessing and Reimarus:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12305", "title": "Gotthold Ephraim Lessing"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12306", "text": "Geotechnical engineering\n\nGeotechnical engineering is the branch of civil engineering concerned with the engineering behavior of earth materials. Geotechnical engineering is important in civil engineering, but also has applications in military, mining, petroleum and other engineering disciplines that are concerned with construction occurring on the surface or within the ground. Geotechnical engineering uses principles of soil mechanics and rock mechanics to investigate subsurface conditions and materials; determine the relevant physical/mechanical and chemical properties of these materials; evaluate stability of natural slopes and man-made soil deposits; assess risks posed by site conditions; design earthworks and structure foundations; and monitor site conditions, earthwork and foundation construction.\n\nA typical geotechnical engineering project begins with a review of project needs to define the required material properties. Then follows a site investigation of soil, rock, fault distribution and bedrock properties on and below an area of interest to determine their engineering properties including how they will interact with, on or in a proposed construction. Site investigations are needed to gain an understanding of the area in or on which the engineering will take place. Investigations can include the assessment of the risk to humans, property and the environment from natural hazards such as earthquakes, landslides, sinkholes, soil liquefaction, debris flows and rockfalls.\n\nA geotechnical engineer then determines and designs the type of foundations, earthworks, and/or pavement subgrades required for the intended man-made structures to be built. Foundations are designed and constructed for structures of various sizes such as high-rise buildings, bridges, medium to large commercial buildings, and smaller structures where the soil conditions do not allow code-based design.\n\nFoundations built for above-ground structures include shallow and deep foundations. Retaining structures include earth-filled dams and retaining walls. Earthworks include embankments, tunnels, dikes and levees, channels, reservoirs, deposition of hazardous waste and sanitary landfills.\n\nGeotechnical engineering is also related to coastal and ocean engineering. Coastal engineering can involve the design and construction of wharves, marinas, and jetties. Ocean engineering can involve foundation and anchor systems for offshore structures such as oil platforms.\n\nThe fields of geotechnical engineering and engineering geology are closely related, and have large areas of overlap. However, the field of geotechnical engineering is a specialty of engineering, where the field of engineering geology is a specialty of geology.\n\nHumans have historically used soil as a material for flood control, irrigation purposes, burial sites, building foundations, and as construction material for buildings. First activities were linked to irrigation and flood control, as demonstrated by traces of dykes, dams, and canals dating back to at least 2000 BCE that were found in ancient Egypt, ancient Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent, as well as around the early settlements of Mohenjo Daro and Harappa in the Indus valley. As the cities expanded, structures were erected supported by formalized foundations; Ancient Greeks notably constructed pad footings and strip-and-raft foundations. Until the 18th century, however, no theoretical basis for soil design had been developed and the discipline was more of an art than a science, relying on past experience.\n\nSeveral foundation-related engineering problems, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, prompted scientists to begin taking a more scientific-based approach to examining the subsurface. The earliest advances occurred in the development of earth pressure theories for the construction of retaining walls. Henri Gautier, a French Royal Engineer, recognized the \"natural slope\" of different soils in 1717, an idea later known as the soil's angle of repose. A rudimentary soil classification system was also developed based on a material's unit weight, which is no longer considered a good indication of soil type.\n\nThe application of the principles of mechanics to soils was documented as early as 1773 when Charles Coulomb (a physicist, engineer, and army Captain) developed improved methods to determine the earth pressures against military ramparts. Coulomb observed that, at failure, a distinct slip plane would form behind a sliding retaining wall and he suggested that the maximum shear stress on the slip plane, for design purposes, was the sum of the soil cohesion, formula_1, and friction formula_2 formula_3, where formula_2 is the normal stress on the slip plane and formula_5 is the friction angle of the soil. By combining Coulomb's theory with Christian Otto Mohr's 2D stress state, the theory became known as Mohr-Coulomb theory. Although it is now recognized that precise determination of cohesion is impossible because formula_1 is not a fundamental soil property, the Mohr-Coulomb theory is still used in practice today.\n\nIn the 19th century Henry Darcy developed what is now known as Darcy's Law describing the flow of fluids in porous media. Joseph Boussinesq (a mathematician and physicist) developed theories of stress distribution in elastic solids that proved useful for estimating stresses at depth in the ground; William Rankine, an engineer and physicist, developed an alternative to Coulomb's earth pressure theory. Albert Atterberg developed the clay consistency indices that are still used today for soil classification. Osborne Reynolds recognized in 1885 that shearing causes volumetric dilation of dense and contraction of loose granular materials.\n\nModern geotechnical engineering is said to have begun in 1925 with the publication of \"Erdbaumechanik\" by Karl Terzaghi (a civil engineer and geologist). Considered by many to be the father of modern soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, Terzaghi developed the principle of effective stress, and demonstrated that the shear strength of soil is controlled by effective stress. Terzaghi also developed the framework for theories of bearing capacity of foundations, and the theory for prediction of the rate of settlement of clay layers due to consolidation. In his 1948 book, Donald Taylor recognized that interlocking and dilation of densely packed particles contributed to the peak strength of a soil. The interrelationships between volume change behavior (dilation, contraction, and consolidation) and shearing behavior were all connected via the theory of plasticity using critical state soil mechanics by Roscoe, Schofield, and Wroth with the publication of \"On the Yielding of Soils\" in 1958. Critical state soil mechanics is the basis for many contemporary advanced constitutive models describing the behavior of soil.\n\nGeotechnical centrifuge modeling is a method of testing physical scale models of geotechnical problems. The use of a centrifuge enhances the similarity of the scale model tests involving soil because the strength and stiffness of soil is very sensitive to the confining pressure. The centrifugal acceleration allows a researcher to obtain large (prototype-scale) stresses in small physical models.\n\nGeotechnical engineers are typically graduates of a four-year civil engineering program and some hold a masters degree. In the USA, geotechnical engineers are typically licensed and regulated as Professional Engineers (PEs) in most states; currently only California and Oregon have licensed geotechnical engineering specialties. The Academy of Geo-Professionals (AGP) began issuing Diplomate, Geotechnical Engineering (D.GE) certification in 2008. State governments will typically license engineers who have graduated from an ABET accredited school, passed the Fundamentals of Engineering examination, completed several years of work experience under the supervision of a licensed Professional Engineer, and passed the Professional Engineering examination.\n\nIn geotechnical engineering, soils are considered a three-phase material composed of: rock or mineral particles, water and air. The voids of a soil, the spaces in between mineral particles, contain the water and air.\n\nThe engineering properties of soils are affected by four main factors: the predominant size of the mineral particles, the type of mineral particles, the grain size distribution, and the relative quantities of mineral, water and air present in the soil matrix. Fine particles (fines) are defined as particles less than 0.075Â mm in diameter.\n\nSome of the important properties of soils that are used by geotechnical engineers to analyze site conditions and design earthworks, retaining structures, and foundations are:\nformula_7\nformula_8\n\n\nGeotechnical engineers and engineering geologists perform geotechnical investigations to obtain information on the physical properties of soil and rock underlying (and sometimes adjacent to) a site to design earthworks and foundations for proposed structures, and for repair of distress to earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions. A geotechnical investigation will include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site. Sometimes, geophysical methods are used to obtain data about sites. Subsurface exploration usually involves in-situ testing (two common examples of in-situ tests are the standard penetration test and cone penetration test). In addition site investigation will often include subsurface sampling and laboratory testing of the soil samples retrieved. The digging of test pits and trenching (particularly for locating faults and slide planes) may also be used to learn about soil conditions at depth. Large diameter borings are rarely used due to safety concerns and expense, but are sometimes used to allow a geologist or engineer to be lowered into the borehole for direct visual and manual examination of the soil and rock stratigraphy.\n\nA variety of soil samplers exist to meet the needs of different engineering projects. The standard penetration test (SPT), which uses a thick-walled split spoon sampler, is the most common way to collect disturbed samples. Piston samplers, employing a thin-walled tube, are most commonly used for the collection of less disturbed samples. More advanced methods, such as ground freezing and the Sherbrooke block sampler, are superior, but even more expensive.\n\nAtterberg limits tests, water content measurements, and grain size analysis, for example, may be performed on disturbed samples obtained from thick walled soil samplers. Properties such as shear strength, stiffness hydraulic conductivity, and coefficient of consolidation may be significantly altered by sample disturbance. To measure these properties in the laboratory, high quality sampling is required. Common tests to measure the strength and stiffness include the triaxial shear and unconfined compression test.\n\nSurface exploration can include geologic mapping, geophysical methods, and photogrammetry; or it can be as simple as an engineer walking around to observe the physical conditions at the site. Geologic mapping and interpretation of geomorphology is typically completed in consultation with a geologist or engineering geologist.\n\nGeophysical exploration is also sometimes used. Geophysical techniques used for subsurface exploration include measurement of seismic waves (pressure, shear, and Rayleigh waves), surface-wave methods and/or downhole methods, and electromagnetic surveys (magnetometer, resistivity, and ground-penetrating radar).\n\nA building's foundation transmits loads from buildings and other structures to the earth. Geotechnical engineers design foundations based on the load characteristics of the structure and the properties of the soils and/or bedrock at the site. In general, geotechnical engineers:\n\nThe primary considerations for foundation support are bearing capacity, settlement, and ground movement beneath the foundations. Bearing capacity is the ability of the site soils to support the loads imposed by buildings or structures. Settlement occurs under all foundations in all soil conditions, though lightly loaded structures or rock sites may experience negligible settlements. For heavier structures or softer sites, both overall settlement relative to unbuilt areas or neighboring buildings, and differential settlement under a single structure, can be concerns. Of particular concern is settlement which occurs over time, as immediate settlement can usually be compensated for during construction. Ground movement beneath a structure's foundations can occur due to shrinkage or swell of expansive soils due to climatic changes, frost expansion of soil, melting of permafrost, slope instability, or other causes. All these factors must be considered during design of foundations.\n\nMany building codes specify basic foundation design parameters for simple conditions, frequently varying by jurisdiction, but such design techniques are normally limited to certain types of construction and certain types of sites, and are frequently very conservative.\n\nIn areas of shallow bedrock, most foundations may bear directly on bedrock; in other areas, the soil may provide sufficient strength for the support of structures. In areas of deeper bedrock with soft overlying soils, deep foundations are used to support structures directly on the bedrock; in areas where bedrock is not economically available, stiff \"bearing layers\" are used to support deep foundations instead.\n\nShallow foundations are a type of foundation that transfers building load to the very near the surface, rather than to a subsurface layer. Shallow foundations typically have a depth to width ratio of less than 1.\n\nFootings (often called \"spread footings\" because they spread the load) are structural elements which transfer structure loads to the ground by direct areal contact. Footings can be isolated footings for point or column loads, or strip footings for wall or other long (line) loads. Footings are normally constructed from reinforced concrete cast directly onto the soil, and are typically embedded into the ground to penetrate through the zone of frost movement and/or to obtain additional bearing capacity.\n\nA variant on spread footings is to have the entire structure bear on a single slab of concrete underlying the entire area of the structure. Slabs must be thick enough to provide sufficient rigidity to spread the bearing loads somewhat uniformly, and to minimize differential settlement across the foundation. In some cases, flexure is allowed and the building is constructed to tolerate small movements of the foundation instead. For small structures, like single-family houses, the slab may be less than 300Â mm thick; for larger structures, the foundation slab may be several meters thick.\n\nSlab foundations can be either slab-on-grade foundations or embedded foundations, typically in buildings with basements. Slab-on-grade foundations must be designed to allow for potential ground movement due to changing soil conditions.\n\nDeep foundations are used for structures or heavy loads when shallow foundations cannot provide adequate capacity, due to size and structural limitations. They may also be used to transfer building loads past weak or compressible soil layers. While shallow foundations rely solely on the bearing capacity of the soil beneath them, deep foundations can rely on end bearing resistance, frictional resistance along their length, or both in developing the required capacity. Geotechnical engineers use specialized tools, such as the cone penetration test, to estimate the amount of skin and end bearing resistance available in the subsurface.\n\nThere are many types of deep foundations including piles, drilled shafts, caissons, piers, and earth stabilized columns. Large buildings such as skyscrapers typically require deep foundations. For example, the Jin Mao Tower in China uses tubular steel piles about 1m (3.3Â feet) driven to a depth of 83.5m (274Â feet) to support its weight.\n\nIn buildings that are constructed and found to undergo settlement, underpinning piles can be used to stabilise the existing building.\n\nThere are three ways to place piles for a deep foundation. They can be driven, drilled, or installed by use of an auger. Driven piles are extended to their necessary depths with the application of external energy in the same way a nail is hammered. There are four typical hammers used to drive such piles: drop hammers, diesel hammers, hydraulic hammers, and air hammers. Drop hammers simply drop a heavy weight onto the pile to drive it, while diesel hammers use a single cylinder diesel engine to force piles through the Earth. Similarly, hydraulic and air hammers supply energy to piles through hydraulic and air forces. Energy imparted from a hammer head varies with type of hammer chosen, and can be as high as a million foot pounds for large scale diesel hammers, a very common hammer head used in practice. Piles are made of a variety of material including steel, timber, and concrete. Drilled piles are created by first drilling a hole to the appropriate depth, and filling it with concrete. Drilled piles can typically carry more load than driven piles, simply due to a larger diameter pile. The auger method of pile installation is similar to drilled pile installation, but concrete is pumped into the hole as the auger is being removed.\n\nA retaining wall is a structure that holds back earth. Retaining walls stabilize soil and rock from downslope movement or erosion and provide support for vertical or near-vertical grade changes. Cofferdams and bulkheads, structures to hold back water, are sometimes also considered retaining walls.\n\nThe primary geotechnical concern in design and installation of retaining walls is that the weight of the retained material is creates lateral earth pressure behind the wall, which can cause the wall to deform or fail. The lateral earth pressure depends on the height of the wall, the density of the soil,the strength of the soil, and the amount of allowable movement of the wall. This pressure is smallest at the top and increases toward the bottom in a manner similar to hydraulic pressure, and tends to push the wall away from the backfill. Groundwater behind the wall that is not dissipated by a drainage system causes an additional horizontal hydraulic pressure on the wall.\n\nGravity walls depend on the size and weight of the wall mass to resist pressures from behind. Gravity walls will often have a slight setback, or batter, to improve wall stability. For short, landscaping walls, gravity walls made from dry-stacked (mortarless) stone or segmental concrete units (masonry units) are commonly used.\n\nEarlier in the 20th century, taller retaining walls were often gravity walls made from large masses of concrete or stone. Today, taller retaining walls are increasingly built as composite gravity walls such as: geosynthetic or steel-reinforced backfill soil with precast facing; gabions (stacked steel wire baskets filled with rocks), crib walls (cells built up log cabin style from precast concrete or timber and filled with soil or free draining gravel) or soil-nailed walls (soil reinforced in place with steel and concrete rods).\n\nFor reinforced-soil gravity walls, the soil reinforcement is placed in horizontal layers throughout the height of the wall. Commonly, the soil reinforcement is geogrid, a high-strength polymer mesh, that provide tensile strength to hold soil together. The wall face is often of precast, segmental concrete units that can tolerate some differential movement. The reinforced soil's mass, along with the facing, becomes the gravity wall. The reinforced mass must be built large enough to retain the pressures from the soil behind it. Gravity walls usually must be a minimum of 30 to 40 percent as deep (thick) as the height of the wall, and may have to be larger if there is a slope or surcharge on the wall.\n\nPrior to the introduction of modern reinforced-soil gravity walls, cantilevered walls were the most common type of taller retaining wall. Cantilevered walls are made from a relatively thin stem of steel-reinforced, cast-in-place concrete or mortared masonry (often in the shape of an inverted T). These walls cantilever loads (like a beam) to a large, structural footing; converting horizontal pressures from behind the wall to vertical pressures on the ground below. Sometimes cantilevered walls are buttressed on the front, or include a counterfort on the back, to improve their stability against high loads. Buttresses are short wing walls at right angles to the main trend of the wall. These walls require rigid concrete footings below seasonal frost depth. This type of wall uses much less material than a traditional gravity wall.\n\nCantilever walls resist lateral pressures by friction at the base of the wall and/or passive earth pressure, the tendency of the soil to resist lateral movement.\n\nBasements are a form of cantilever walls, but the forces on the basement walls are greater than on conventional walls because the basement wall is not free to move.\n\nShoring of temporary excavations frequently requires a wall design which does not extend laterally beyond the wall, so shoring extends below the planned base of the excavation. Common methods of shoring are the use of sheet piles or soldier beams and lagging. Sheet piles are a form of driven piling using thin interlocking sheets of steel to obtain a continuous barrier in the ground, and are driven prior to excavation. Soldier beams are constructed of wide flange steel H sections spaced about 2â3 m apart, driven prior to excavation. As the excavation proceeds, horizontal timber or steel sheeting (lagging) is inserted behind the H pile flanges.\n\nIn some cases, the lateral support which can be provided by the shoring wall alone is insufficient to resist the planned lateral loads; in this case additional support is provided by walers or tie-backs. Walers are structural elements which connect across the excavation so that the loads from the soil on either side of the excavation are used to resist each other, or which transfer horizontal loads from the shoring wall to the base of the excavation. Tie-backs are steel tendons drilled into the face of the wall which extend beyond the soil which is applying pressure to the wall, to provide additional lateral resistance to the wall.\n\nExcavation is the process of training earth according to requirement by removing the soil from the site.\n\nFilling is the process of training earth according to requirement by placing the soil on the site.\n\nCompaction is the process by which the density of soil is increased and permeability of soil is decreased. Fill placement work often has specifications requiring a specific degree of compaction, or alternatively, specific properties of the compacted soil. In-situ soils can be compacted by rolling, deep dynamic compaction, vibration, blasting, gyrating, kneading, compaction grouting etc.\n\nGround Improvement is a technique that improves the engineering properties of the treated soil mass. Usually, the properties modified are shear strength, stiffness and permeability. Ground improvement has developed into a sophisticated tool to support foundations for a wide variety of structures. Properly applied, i.e. after giving due consideration to the nature of the ground being improved and the type and sensitivity of the structures being built, ground improvement often reduces direct costs and saves time.\n\nSlope stability is the potential of soil covered slopes to withstand and undergo movement. Stability is determined by the balance of shear stress and shear strength. A previously stable slope may be initially affected by preparatory factors, making the slope conditionally unstable. Triggering factors of a slope failure can be climatic events can then make a slope actively unstable, leading to mass movements. Mass movements can be caused by increases in shear stress, such as loading, lateral pressure, and transient forces. Alternatively, shear strength may be decreased by weathering, changes in pore water pressure, and organic material.\n\nSeveral modes of failure for earth slopes include falls, topples, slides, and flows. In slopes with coarse grained soil or rocks, falls typically occur as the rapid descent of rocks and other loose slope material. A slope topples when a large column of soil tilts over its vertical axis at failure. Typical slope stability analysis considers sliding failures, categorized mainly as rotational slides or translational slides. As implied by the name, rotational slides fail along a generally curved surface, while translational slides fail along a more planar surface. A slope failing as a flow would resemble a fluid flowing downhill.\n\nStability analysis is needed for the design of engineered slopes and for estimating the risk of slope failure in natural or designed slopes. A common assumption is that a slope consists of a layer of soil sitting on top of a rigid base. The mass and the base are assumed to interact via friction. The interface between the mass and the base can be planar, curved, or have some other complex geometry. The goal of a slope stability analysis is to determine the conditions under which the mass will slip relative to the base and lead to slope failure.\n\nIf the interface between the mass and the base of a slope has a complex geometry, slope stability analysis is difficult and numerical solution methods are required. Typically, the exact geometry of the interface is not known and a simplified interface geometry is assumed. Finite slopes require three-dimensional models to be analyzed. To keep the problem simple, most slopes are analyzed assuming that the slopes are infinitely wide and can therefore be represented by two-dimensional models. A slope can be drained or undrained. The undrained condition is used in the calculations to produce conservative estimates of risk.\n\nA popular stability analysis approach is based on principles pertaining to the limit equilibrium concept. This method analyzes a finite or infinite slope as if it were about to fail along its sliding failure surface. Equilibrium stresses are calculated along the failure plane, and compared to the soils shear strength as determined by Terzaghiâs shear strength equation. Stability is ultimately decided by a factor of safety equal to the ratio of shear strength to the equilibrium stresses along the failure surface. A factor of safety greater than one generally implies a stable slope, failure of which should not occur assuming the slope is undisturbed. A factor of safety of 1.5 for static conditions is commonly used in practice.\n\n\"Offshore\" (or \"marine\") \"geotechnical engineering\" is concerned with foundation design for human-made structures in the sea, away from the coastline (in opposition to \"onshore\" or \"nearshore\"). Oil platforms, artificial islands and submarine pipelines are examples of such structures. There are number of significant differences between onshore and offshore geotechnical engineering. Notably, ground improvement (on the seabed) and site investigation are more expensive, the offshore structures are exposed to a wider range of geohazards, and the environmental and financial consequences are higher in case of failure. Offshore structures are exposed to various environmental loads, notably wind, waves and currents. These phenomena may affect the integrity or the serviceability of the structure and its foundation during its operational lifespan â they need to be taken into account in offshore design.\n\nIn subsea geotechnical engineering, seabed materials are considered a two-phase material composed of 1) rock or mineral particles and 2) water. Structures may be fixed in place in the seabedâas is the case for piers, jettys and fixed-bottom wind turbinesâor may be a floating structure that remain roughly fixed relative to its geotechnical anchor point. Undersea mooring of human-engineered floating structures include a large number of offshore oil and gas platforms and, since 2008, a few floating wind turbines. Two common types of engineered design for anchoring floating structures include tension-leg and catenary loose mooring systems. \"Tension\nleg mooring systems have vertical tethers under tension providing large restoring moments in pitch and roll. Catenary mooring systems provide station keeping for an offshore structure yet provide little stiffness at low tensions.\"\n\nGeosynthetics are a type of plastic polymer products used in geotechnical engineering that improve engineering performance while reducing costs. This includes geotextiles, geogrids, geomembranes, geocells, and geocomposites. The synthetic nature of the products make them suitable for use in the ground where high levels of durability are required; their main functions include: drainage, filtration, reinforcement, separation and containment. Geosynthetics are available in a wide range of forms and materials, each to suit a slightly different end use, although they are frequently used together. These products have a wide range of applications and are currently used in many civil and geotechnical engineering applications including: roads, airfields, railroads, embankments, piled embankments, retaining structures, reservoirs, canals, dams, landfills, bank protection and coastal engineering.\n", "id": "12306", "title": "Geotechnical engineering"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12307", "text": "Gustave Flaubert\n\nGustave Flaubert (; 12 December 1821 â 8 May 1880) was an influential French novelist who was perhaps the leading exponent of literary realism in his country. He is known especially for his first published novel, \"Madame Bovary\" (1857), for his \"Correspondence\", and for his scrupulous devotion to his style and aesthetics. The celebrated short story writer Guy de Maupassant was a protÃ©gÃ© of Flaubert.\n\nFlaubert was born on 12 December 1821, in Rouen, in the Seine-Maritime department of Upper Normandy, in northern France. He was the second son of Anne Justine Caroline (nÃ©e Fleuriot; 1793â1872) and Achille-ClÃ©ophas Flaubert (1784â1846), director and senior surgeon of the major hospital in Rouen. He began writing at an early age, as early as eight according to some sources.\n\nHe was educated at the \"LycÃ©e Pierre Corneille\" in Rouen, and did not leave until 1840, when he went to Paris to study law. In Paris, he was an indifferent student and found the city distasteful. He made a few acquaintances, including Victor Hugo. Toward the end of 1840, he traveled in the Pyrenees and Corsica. In 1846, after an attack of epilepsy, he left Paris and abandoned the study of law.\n\nFrom 1846 to 1854, Flaubert had a relationship with the poet Louise Colet; his letters to her have survived. After leaving Paris, he returned to Croisset, near the Seine, close to Rouen, and lived there for the rest of his life. He made occasional visits to Paris and England, where he apparently had a mistress. Flaubert never married. According to his biographer Ãmile Faguet, his affair with Louise Colet was his only serious romantic relationship. He sometimes visited prostitutes. \n\nWith his lifelong friend Maxime Du Camp, he traveled in Brittany in 1846. In 1849â50 he went on a long journey to the Middle East, visiting Greece and Egypt. In Beirut he contracted syphilis. He spent five weeks in Istanbul in 1850. He visited Carthage in 1858 to conduct research for his novel \"SalammbÃ´\".\n\nFlaubert was very open about his sexual activities with prostitutes in his writings on his travels. He suspected that a chancre on his penis was from a Maronite or a Turkish girl. He also engaged in intercourse with male prostitutes in Beirut and Egypt; in one of his letters, he describes a \"pockmarked young rascal wearing a white turban\".\n\nFlaubert was a tireless worker and often complained in his letters to friends about the strenuous nature of his work. He was close to his niece, Caroline Commanville, and had a close friendship and correspondence with George Sand. He occasionally visited Parisian acquaintances, including Ãmile Zola, Alphonse Daudet, Ivan Turgenev, and Edmond and Jules de Goncourt.\n\nThe 1870s were a difficult time for Flaubert. Prussian soldiers occupied his house during the War of 1870, and his mother died in 1872. After her death, he fell into financial difficulty due to business failures on the part of his niece's husband. Flaubert suffered from venereal diseases most of his life. His health declined and he died at Croisset of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1880 at the age of 58. He was buried in the family vault in the cemetery of Rouen. A monument to him by Henri Chapu was unveiled at the museum of Rouen.\n\nHis first finished work was \"November\", a novella, which was completed in 1842.\n\nIn September 1849, Flaubert completed the first version of a novel, \"The Temptation of Saint Anthony.\" He read the novel aloud to Louis Bouilhet and Maxime Du Camp over the course of four days, not allowing them to interrupt or give any opinions. At the end of the reading, his friends told him to throw the manuscript in the fire, suggesting instead that he focus on day-to-day life rather than fantastic subjects.\n\nIn 1850, after returning from Egypt, Flaubert began work on \"Madame Bovary\". The novel, which took five years to write, was serialized in the \"Revue de Paris\" in 1856. The government brought an action against the publisher and author on the charge of immorality, which was heard during the following year, but both were acquitted. When \"Madame Bovary\" appeared in book form, it met with a warm reception.\n\nIn 1858, Flaubert traveled to Carthage to gather material for his next novel, \"SalammbÃ´\". The novel was completed in 1862 after four years of work.\n\nDrawing on his youth, Flaubert next wrote \"L'Ãducation sentimentale\" (\"Sentimental Education\"), an effort that took seven years. This was his last complete novel, published in the year 1869.\n\nHe wrote an unsuccessful drama, \"Le Candidat,\" and published a reworked version of \"The Temptation of Saint Anthony\", portions of which had been published as early as 1857. He devoted much of his time to an ongoing project, \"Les Deux Cloportes (The Two Woodlice)\", which later became \"Bouvard et PÃ©cuchet\", breaking from the obsessive project only to write the \"Three Tales\" in 1877. This book comprised three stories: \"Un CÅur simple\" (\"A Simple Heart\"), \"La LÃ©gende de Saint-Julien l'Hospitalier\" (\"The Legend of St. Julian the Hospitaller\"), and \"HÃ©rodias\" (\"Herodias\"). After the publication of the stories, he spent the remainder of his life toiling on the unfinished \"Bouvard et PÃ©cuchet\", which was posthumously printed in 1881. It was a grand satire on the futility of human knowledge and the ubiquity of mediocrity. He believed the work to be his masterpiece, though the posthumous version received lukewarm reviews. Flaubert was a prolific letter writer, and his letters have been collected in several publications.\n\nAt the time of his death, he may have been working on a further historical novel, based on the Battle of Thermopylae.\n\nFlaubert famously avoided the inexact, the abstract, the vaguely inapt expression, and scrupulously eschewed the clichÃ©. In a letter to George Sand he said that he spends his time \"trying to write harmonious sentences, avoiding assonances.\"\n\nFlaubert believed in, and pursued, the principle of finding \"\"le mot juste\"\" (\"the right word\"), which he considered as the key means to achieve quality in literary art. He worked in sullen solitudeâsometimes occupying a week in the completion of one pageânever satisfied with what he had composed. In Flaubert's correspondence he intimates this, explaining correct prose did not flow out of him and that his style was achieved through work and revision.\n\nThis painstaking style of writing is also evident when one compares Flaubertâs output over a lifetime to that of his peers (for example Balzac or Zola). Flaubert published much less prolifically than was the norm for his time and never got near the pace of a novel a year, as his peers often achieved during their peaks of activity. Walter Pater famously called Flaubert the \"martyr of style.\"\n\nIn the assessment of critic James Wood:\nAs a writer, other than a pure stylist, Flaubert was nearly equal parts romantic and realist. Hence, members of various schools, especially realists and formalists, have traced their origins to his work. The exactitude with which he adapts his expressions to his purpose can be seen in all parts of his work, especially in the portraits he draws of the figures in his principal romances. The degree to which Flaubert's fame has extended since his death presents an interesting chapter of literary history in itself. He is also credited with spreading the popularity of the colour Tuscany Cypress, a colour often mentioned in his chef-d'oeuvre \"Madame Bovary\".\n\nFlaubert's lean and precise writing style has had a large influence on 20th-century writers such as Franz Kafka and J. M. Coetzee. As Vladimir Nabokov discussed in his famous lecture series:\n\nThe greatest literary influence upon Kafka was Flaubert's. Flaubert who loathed pretty-pretty prose would have applauded Kafka's attitude towards his tool. Kafka liked to draw his terms from the language of law and science, giving them a kind of ironic precision, with no intrusion of the author's private sentiments; this was exactly Flaubert's method through which he achieved a singular poetic effect. The legacy of his work habits can best be described, therefore, as paving the way towards a slower and more introspective manner of writing.\n\nThe publication of \"Madame Bovary\" in 1856 was followed by more scandal than admiration; it was not understood at first that this novel was the beginning of something new: the scrupulously truthful portraiture of life. Gradually, this aspect of his genius was accepted, and it began to crowd out all others. At the time of his death he was widely regarded as the most influential French Realist. Under this aspect Flaubert exercised an extraordinary influence over Guy de Maupassant, Edmond de Goncourt, Alphonse Daudet, and Zola. Even after the decline of the Realist school, Flaubert did not lose prestige in the literary community; he continues to appeal to other writers because of his deep commitment to aesthetic principles, his devotion to style, and his indefatigable pursuit of the perfect expression.\n\nHis \"Åuvres ComplÃ¨tes\" (8 vols., 1885) were printed from the original manuscripts, and included, besides the works mentioned already, the two plays \"Le Candidat\" and \"Le ChÃ¢teau des cÅurs\". Another edition (10 vols.) appeared in 1873â85. Flaubert's correspondence with George Sand was published in 1884 with an introduction by Guy de Maupassant.\n\nHe has been admired or written about by almost every major literary personality of the 20th century, including philosophers and sociologists such as Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Pierre Bourdieu and Jean-Paul Sartre whose partially psychoanalytic portrait of Flaubert in \"The Family Idiot\" was published in 1971. Georges Perec named \"Sentimental Education\" as one of his favourite novels. The Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa is another great admirer of Flaubert. Apart from \"Perpetual Orgy\", which is solely devoted to Flaubert's art, one can find lucid discussions in Vargas Llosa's \"Letters to a Young Novelist\" (published 2003). In public lecture on May 1966 at the Kaufmann Art Gallery in New York, Marshall McLuhan claimed that, \"I derived all my knowledge of media from people like Flaubert and Rimbaud and Baudelaire.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12307", "title": "Gustave Flaubert"}

Beginning in the late 1960s, Chaitin made contributions to algorithmic information theory and metamathematics, in particular a computer-theoretic result equivalent to GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem. He is considered to be one of the founders of what is today known as Kolmogorov (or Kolmogorov-Chaitin) complexity together with Andrei Kolmogorov and Ray Solomonoff. Today, algorithmic information theory is a common subject in any computer science curriculum.\n\nHe attended the Bronx High School of Science and City College of New York, where he (still in his teens) developed the theory that led to his independent discovery of Kolmogorov complexity.\n\nChaitin has defined Chaitin's constant Î©, a real number whose digits are equidistributed and which is sometimes informally described as an expression of the probability that a random program will halt. Î© has the mathematical property that it is definable but not computable.\n\nChaitin's early work on algorithmic information theory followed after the work of Solomonoff, Kolmogorov, and Martin-LÃ¶f.\n\nChaitin is also the originator of using graph coloring to do register allocation in compiling, a process known as Chaitin's algorithm.\n\nHe was formerly a researcher at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York and remains an emeritus researcher. He has written more than 10 book titles that have been translated to about 15 languages. He is today interested in questions of metabiology and information-theoretic formalizations of the theory of evolution.\n\nChaitin also writes about philosophy, especially metaphysics and philosophy of mathematics (particularly about epistemological matters in mathematics). In metaphysics, Chaitin claims that algorithmic information theory is the key to solving problems in the field of biology (obtaining a formal definition of 'life', its origin and evolution) and neuroscience (the problem of consciousness and the study of the mind).\n\nIn recent writings, he defends a position known as digital philosophy. In the epistemology of mathematics, he claims that his findings in mathematical logic and algorithmic information theory show there are \"mathematical facts that are true for no reason, they're true by accident. They are random mathematical facts\". Chaitin proposes that mathematicians must abandon any hope of proving those mathematical facts and adopt a quasi-empirical methodology.\n\nIn 1995 he was given the degree of doctor of science \"honoris causa\" by the University of Maine. In 2002 he was given the title of honorary professor by the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina, where his parents were born and where Chaitin spent part of his youth. In 2007 he was given a Leibniz Medal by Wolfram Research. In 2009 he was given the degree of doctor of philosophy \"honoris causa\" by the National University of CÃ³rdoba. He was formerly a researcher at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center and is now a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nSome philosophers and logicians strongly disagree with the philosophical conclusions that Chaitin has drawn from his theorems.\nThe logician Torkel FranzÃ©n criticized Chaitinâs interpretation of GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem and the alleged explanation for it that Chaitinâs work represents.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12308", "title": "Gregory Chaitin"}

He rose to fame playing guitar with his rock band Bijelo Dugme. Among his better known scores are three of Emir Kusturica's films (\"Time of the Gypsies\", \"Arizona Dream\", and \"Underground\").\n\nBorn in Sarajevo, PR Bosnia-Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia to a Croat father Franjo BregoviÄ and Serb mother Borka PeriÅ¡iÄ, Goran grew up with an older sister Dajana and a younger brother Predrag. Their father was from Croatian Zagorje, specifically Sveti Petar Ävrstec village near KriÅ¾evci, while their mother was born in Virovitica to parents that shortly before her birth arrived in the nearby village of Äemernica, settling there from the village of Kazanci near Gacko in eastern Herzegovina. Her father, Goran's maternal grandfather, fought in the Serbian Army at the Macedonian Front during World War I and as a reward received land in Slavonia where he soon moved his family.\n\nGoran's parents met shortly after the end of World War II in Virovitica where his mother Borka lived and his father Franjo (who fought on the Partisan side during the war) attended a Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) military school. Franjo BregoviÄ soon got his first job, teaching ballistics at a Sarajevo military school, so the family (which at the time only had a daughter) moved there. Goran, their second child, was born in 1950.\n\nGoran was 10 years old when his parents divorced. In later interviews he mentioned his father's alcoholism as the reason for the breakdown of his parents' marriage. Soon after the split, his father moved to Livno, taking Goran's younger brother Predrag with him while Goran remained living with his mother in Sarajevo, visiting his father and brother every summer in Livno. Their father soon retired and eventually moved back to his home village in Zagorje while Goran's brother Predrag later moved back to Sarajevo for university studies.\n\nGoran played violin in a music school. However, deemed untalented, he was thrown out during second grade. His musical education was thus reduced to what his friend taught him until Goran's mother bought him his first guitar in his early teens. BregoviÄ wanted to enroll in a fine arts high school, but his aunt told his mother that it was supposedly full of homosexuals, which precipitated his mother's decision to send him to a technical (traffic) school. As a compromise for not getting his way, she allowed him to grow his hair long. Upon entering high school, Goran joined the school band Izohipse where he began on bass guitar. Soon, however, he was kicked out of that school too (this time for misbehavior - he crashed into a school-owned Mercedes-Benz). BregoviÄ then entered grammar school and its school band BeÅ¡tije (again as a bass guitar player). When he was 16, his mother left him and moved to the coast, meaning that other than having a few relatives to rely on, he mostly had to take care of himself. He did that by playing folk music in a kafana in Konjic, working on construction sites, and selling newspapers.\n\nSpotting him at a BeÅ¡tije gig in 1969, Å½eljko Bebek invited 18-year-old BregoviÄ to play bass guitar in his band Kodeksi, which Goran gladly accepted.\n\nEventually, Kodeksi shifted setup so BregoviÄ moved from bass to lead guitar, resulting in Kodeksi having the following line-up during summer 1970: Goran BregoviÄ, Å½eljko Bebek, Zoran RedÅ¾iÄ and MiliÄ VukaÅ¡inoviÄ. All of them would eventually become members of Bijelo Dugme at some point in the future. At the time, they were largely influenced by Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. During the fall of 1970, this resulted in departure of Å½eljko Bebek, who (both as rhythm guitar player and singer) got phased out of the band. At the end of the year, Goran's mother and Zoran's brother arrived in Naples and took them back to Sarajevo.\n\nThen, in the autumn of 1971, Goran enrolled at the University of Sarajevo's Faculty of Philosophy, studying philosophy and sociology. He soon quit, however. At the same time, MiliÄ VukaÅ¡inoviÄ left for London, so BregoviÄ formed a band with Nuno ArnautaliÄ called Jutro (Morning), which RedÅ¾iÄ soon joined as well. Over the next few years, the band changed lineups frequently, and on 1 January 1974 modified its name to Bijelo Dugme (\"White Button\").\n\nFrom 1974 until 1989, BregoviÄ played lead guitar and was the main creative force behind Bijelo Dugme (\"White Button\"). For years they stood as one of the most popular bands in SFR Yugoslavia.\n\nAt the time Bijelo Dugme was falling apart, Goran entered the world of film music. His first project was Emir Kusturica's \"Time of the Gypsies\" (1989). This turned out to be a great success (both the film and the soundtrack). Goran and Emir's collaboration continued, and Goran composed music (which was performed by Iggy Pop) for Emir's next film \"Arizona Dream\" (1993). During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Goran lived in Paris, but he also lived in Belgrade. His next major project, music for Patrice ChÃ©reau's \"Queen Margot\" was a great success as well, and as a result, the film won two awards on the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. The next year's Golden Palm award \nwent to \"Underground\", for which Goran BregoviÄ composed the music.\n\nIn 1997, he worked with Turkish singer Sezen Aksu on her album \"DÃ¼ÄÃ¼n ve Cenaze\" (\"Wedding and Funeral\"). After that album, he continued making composite albums with other musicians that were based on his music and singers' lyrics.\n\nHe made an album with George Dalaras in 1999 named \"Thessaloniki â Yannena with Two Canvas Shoes\". In the same year, BregoviÄ recorded an album called \"Kayah i BregoviÄ\" (Kayah and BregoviÄ) with popular Polish singer Kayah which sold over 700,000 copies in Poland (seven times platinum record).\n\nIn 2001, he recorded another album with another Polish singer, Krzysztof Krawczyk, titled \"Daj mi drugie Å¼ycie\" (\"Give Me Second Life\").\n\nIn 2005, BregoviÄ took part in three large farewell concerts of Bijelo Dugme.\n\nA number of works created by BregoviÄ can be heard on the soundtrack to the 2006 film , most notably \"ÄurÄevdan.\" The film itself actually features more BregoviÄ samples than the soundtrack. Two musical numbers by BregoviÄ, \"Ne Siam Kurve Tuke Sijam Prostitutke,\" and \"Gas, Gas\" were featured in the soundtrack of the 2012 Brazilian \"novela\", Salve Jorge, on the television network Rede Globo.\n\nFor many years BregoviÄ performed with a large ensemble of musicians: a brass band, bagpipes, a string ensemble, a tuxedo-clad all-male choir from Belgrade, women wearing traditional Bulgarian costumes, and Roma singers make up his 40-piece band and orchestra.\n\nSince 1998, and until about 2012, BregoviÄ has been performing his music mainly in the form of concerts all over the world with his Weddings and Funerals Orchestra. This consists of 10 people (in the small version) or 37 (in the large version, although, in some instances, this number varies, depending on participants from the host country).\n\nSince 2012 the orchestra consists of 9 people (in the small version) or 19 (in the large version), as it played in New York at the Lincoln Center on 15 July and 16 July 2016. \n\nThe small orchestra consists of Muharem-Muki Redzepi (vocals, drums), Bokan StankoviÄ (first trumpet), DragiÄ VeliÄoviÄ (second trumpet), Stojan Dimov (sax, clarinet), Aleksandar RajkoviÄ (first trombone, glockenspiel), MiloÅ¡ MihajloviÄ (second trombone), female vocals Bulgarian singers Daniela Radkova-Aleksandrova, and Ludmila Radkova-Traikova, and Goran himself. \nThe large orchestra includes also string quartet: Ivana MateijÄ (first violin), Bojana JovanoviÄ-JotiÄ (second violin), SaÅ¡a MirkoviÄ (viola), and Tatjana JovanoviÄ-MirkoviÄ, as well as sextet of male voices: Dejan PesiÄ (first tenor), Milan PaniÄ and Ranko JoviÄ (second tenors), Aleksandar NovakoviÄ (baritone), Dusan LjubinkoviÄ and SiniÅ¡a Dutina (basses). \n\nIn previous years, in the orchestra the following musicians have performed: Ogi RadivojeviÄ and Alen AdemoviÄ (vocals, drums), Dalibor LukiÄ (second trumpet), Dejan ManigodiÄ (tuba), Vaska Jankovska (vocals).\n\nIn 2013, as part of his Asia-Pacific tour (including Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong), BregoviÄ performed with a string quartet, a male choir, Bulgarian singers and half of a brass band. The other part of the brass band - including bass and percussions - were being played from his computer.\n\nDuring the Eurovision 2008 final in Belgrade Arena, Serbia, he had a small concert.\nHe also composed the Serbian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010; 'Ovo Je Balkan' sung by Milan StankoviÄ.\n\nBregoviÄ's compositions, extending Balkan musical inspirations to innovative extremes, draw upon European classicism and Balkan rhythms.\n\nBregoviÄ's music carries Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Greek, Romani, Romanian, Serbian, Albanian and Turkish themes and is a fusion of popular music with traditional polyphonic music from the Balkans, tango, and brass bands.\n\nIn 1993, BregoviÄ married his long-time girlfriend DÅ¾enana SudÅ¾uka. The wedding ceremony held in Paris featured film director Emir Kusturica as the groom's best man and longtime Bijelo Dugme backing vocal, Amila SulejmanoviÄ as the bride's maid of honour.\n\nThe couple has three daughters: Ema (born in March 1995), Una (February 2002), and Lulu (May 2004).\n\nBregoviÄ owns real-estate properties all over the world, but spends most of his time between Belgrade, where most of his musical collaborators reside, and Paris, where his spouse lives with their three daughters.\n\nHe also has a daughter named Å½eljka (born out of wedlock from a previous relationship) who gave birth to Goran's grand daughter, Bianca. He has a brother named Predrag who lives in New York City, and a sister, Dajana who lives in Split.\n\nOn 12 June 2008, BregoviÄ injured his spine, falling from a tree. He fell four meters from a cherry tree in the garden of his home in Senjak, a Belgrade district, breaking vertebrae. However, according to the doctors, his condition was \"stable without neurological complications.\" After surgery, he made a quick recovery and on 8 July and 9 July, he held two big concerts in New York City, where for more than two hours each night, he proved his performance skills had not suffered from the accident.\n\nBregoviÄ prefers to avoid delving into politics. In 2009, he said, \"Yugoslavia is the intersection of so many worlds: Orthodox, Catholic, Muslim. With music, I don't have to represent anyone, except myself -- because I speak the first language of the world, the one everyone understands: music.\" In March 2015, BregoviÄ performed in a concert in Crimea, which was annexed by Russia the previous year. The following month, the Life Festival in OÅwiÄcim, Poland cancelled an appearance by BregoviÄ, saying that his statements were \"contrary to the values cherished by the Life Festival founders.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "12309", "title": "Goran BregoviÄ"}

It is typical for mammals, but also occurs for some non-mammals. Mammals during pregnancy can have one or more gestations at the same time (multiple gestations).\n\nThe time interval of a gestation is called the \"gestation period\". In human obstetrics, \"gestational age\" refers to the embryonic or fetal age plus two weeks. This is approximately the duration since the woman's last menstrual period (LMP) began.\n\nIn mammals, pregnancy begins when a zygote (fertilized ovum) implants in the female's uterus and ends once the fetus leaves the uterus.\n\nOn the main article link above, are average and approximate gestation values ordered by number of days (note: human gestational age is counted from the last menstrual period; for other animals the counting method varies, so these figures could be 14 days off)\n\nHuman pregnancy can be divided roughly into three trimesters, each approximately three months long. The first trimester is from the last period to the 13th week, the second trimester is from the 14th to 27th week, and the third trimester is from the 28th week to the 42nd week.\n\nIn humans, birth normally occurs at a gestational age of about 40 weeks, though it is common for births to occur from 37 to 42 weeks. After 8 weeks, the embryo is called a fetus. \n\nA viviparous animal is an animal employing vivipary: the embryo develops inside the body of the mother, as opposed to outside in an egg (ovipary). The mother then gives live birth. The less developed form of vivipary is called ovoviviparity, which, for instance, occurs in most vipers. The more developed form of vivipary is called placental viviparity; mammals are the best example, but it has also evolved independently in other animals, such as in scorpions, some sharks, and in velvet worms. Viviparous offspring live independently and require an external food supply from birth. Certain lizards also employ this method such as the genera \"Tiliqua\" and \"Corucia.\" The placenta is attached directly to the mother in these lizards which is called viviparous matrotrophy.\n\nOvoviviparous animals develop within eggs that remain within the mother's body up until they hatch or are about to hatch. This strategy of birth is known as ovoviviparity. It is similar to vivipary in that the embryo develops within the mother's body. Unlike the embryos of viviparous species, ovoviviparous embryos are nourished by the egg yolk rather than by the mother's body. However, the mother's body does provide gas exchange. Ovoviviparity is the method of reproduction used by many aquatic life forms such as fish and some sharks, reptiles, and invertebrates. The young of ovoviviparous amphibians are sometimes born as larvae, and undergo metamorphosis outside the body of the mother.\n\nThe Syngnathidae family of fish has the unique characteristic whereby females lay their eggs in a brood pouch on the male's chest, and the male incubates the eggs. Fertilization may take place in the pouch or before implantation in the water. Included in Syngnathidae are seahorses, the pipefish, and the weedy and leafy sea dragons. Syngnathidae is the only family in the animal kingdom to which the term \"male pregnancy\" has been applied.\n\n\n\n", "id": "12312", "title": "Gestation"}

That is, if is a positive integer:\n\nThe gamma function is defined for all complex numbers except the non-positive integers. For complex numbers with a positive real part, it is defined via a convergent improper integral:\n\nThis integral function is extended by analytic continuation to all complex numbers except the non-positive integers (where the function has simple poles), yielding the meromorphic function we call the gamma function. In fact the gamma function corresponds to the Mellin transform of the negative exponential function:\n\nThe gamma function is a component in various probability-distribution functions, and as such it is applicable in the fields of probability and statistics, as well as combinatorics.\n\nThe gamma function can be seen as a solution to the following interpolation problem:\n\nA plot of the first few factorials makes clear that such a curve can be drawn, but it would be preferable to have a formula that precisely describes the curve, in which the number of operations does not depend on the size ofÂ . The simple formula for the factorial, , cannot be used directly for fractional values of since it is only valid when is a natural number (\"i.e.\", a positive integer). There are, relatively speaking, no such simple solutions for factorials; no finite combination of sums, products, powers, exponential functions, or logarithms will suffice to expressÂ ; but it is possible to find a general formula for factorials using tools such as integrals and limits from calculus. A good solution to this is the gamma function.\n\nThere are infinitely many continuous extensions of the factorial to non-integers: infinitely many curves can be drawn through any set of isolated points. The gamma function is the most useful solution in practice, being analytic (except at the non-positive integers), and it can be characterized in several ways. However, it is not the only analytic function which extends the factorial, as adding to it any analytic function which is zero on the positive integers, such as , will give another function with that property.\n\nA more restrictive property than satisfying the above interpolation is to satisfy the recurrence relation defining a translated version of the factorial function,\n\nfor equal to any positive real number. The BohrâMollerup theorem proves that these properties, together with the assumption that be logarithmically convex (or \"super-convex\"), uniquely determine for positive, real inputs. From there, the gamma function can be extended to all real and complex values (except the negative integers and zero) by using the unique analytic continuation of . Also see Euler's infinite product definition below where the properties and together with the asymptotic requirement that uniquely define the same function.\n\nThe notation is due to Legendre. If the real part of the complex numberÂ  is positive (), then the integral\n\nconverges absolutely, and is known as the Euler integral of the second kind (the Euler integral of the first kind defines the beta function). Using integration by parts, one sees that:\n\nWe can calculate formula_11:\n\nGiven that formula_14 and formula_15\nfor all positive integers formula_17.\n\nThe identity formula_18 can be used (or, yielding the same result, analytic continuation can be used) to uniquely extend the integral formulation for formula_19 to a meromorphic function defined for all complex numbersÂ formula_20, except integers less than or equal to zero.\n\nIt is this extended version that is commonly referred to as the gamma function.\n\nWhen seeking to approximate for a complex number , it turns out that it is effective to first compute for some large integer , then use that to approximate a value for , and then use the recursion relation backwards times, to unwind it to an approximation for . Furthermore, this approximation is exact in the limit as goes to infinity.\n\nSpecifically, for a fixed integer , it is the case that\nand we can ask that the same formula is obeyed when the arbitrary integer is replaced by an arbitrary complex number \nMultiplying both sides by gives\nThis infinite product formula converges for all complex numbersÂ  except the negative integers, which fail because trying to use the recursion relation backwards through the value involves a division by zero.\n\nSimilarly for the gamma function, the definition as an infinite product due to Euler is valid for all complex numbers formula_20 except the non-positive integers:\nBy this construction, the gamma function is the unique function that simultaneously satisfies formula_14, formula_27 for all complex numbers formula_20 except the non-positive integers, and formula_29 for all complex numbers formula_20.\n\nThe definition for the gamma function due to Weierstrass is also valid for all complex numbersÂ  except the non-positive integers:\nwhere formula_32 is the EulerâMascheroni constant.\n\nA parameterization of the incomplete gamma function in terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials is\nwhich converges for formula_34 and formula_35.\n\nOther important functional equations for the gamma function are Euler's reflection formula\n\nwhich implies\n\nand the duplication formula\n\nThe duplication formula is a special case of the multiplication theorem\n\nA simple but useful property, which can be seen from the limit definition, is:\n\nPerhaps the best-known value of the gamma function at a non-integer argument is\n\nwhich can be found by setting in the reflection or duplication formulas, by using the relation to the beta function given below with , or simply by making the substitution in the integral definition of the gamma function, resulting in a Gaussian integral. In general, for non-negative integer values of we have:\n\nThe derivatives of the gamma function are described in terms of the polygamma function. For example:\n\nFor a positive integerÂ  the derivative of the gamma function can be calculated as follows (hereÂ  is the EulerâMascheroni constant):\n\nFor the th derivative of the gamma function is:\n\n\nSome particular values of the gamma function are:\nThe complex-valued gamma function is undefined for non-positive integers, but in these cases the value can be defined in the Riemann sphere as . The reciprocal gamma function is well defined and analytic at these values (and in the entire complex plane):\n\nBecause the gamma and factorial functions grow so rapidly for moderately large arguments, many computing environments include a function that returns the natural logarithm of the gamma function (often given the name lgamma or lngamma in programming environments or gammaln in spreadsheets); this grows much more slowly, and for combinatorial calculations allows adding and subtracting logs instead of multiplying and dividing very large values. The digamma function, which is the derivative of this function, is also commonly seen.\nIn the context of technical and physical applications, e.g. with wave propagation, the functional equation\n\nis often used since it allows one to determine function values in one strip of width 1 in from the neighbouring strip. In particular, starting with a good approximation for aÂ  with large real part one may go step by step down to the desiredÂ . Following an indication of Carl Friedrich Gauss, Rocktaeschel (1922) proposed for an approximation for large :\n\nThis can be used to accurately approximate for with a smaller via (P.E.BÃ¶hmer, 1939)\n\nA more accurate approximation can be obtained by using more terms from the asymptotic expansions of and , which are based on Stirling's approximation.\n\nIn a more \"natural\" presentation:\n\nThe coefficients of the terms with of in the last expansion are simply\n\nwhere the are the Bernoulli numbers.\n\nThe BohrâMollerup theorem states that among all functions extending the factorial functions to the positive real numbers, only the gamma function is log-convex, that is, its natural logarithm is convex on the positive real axis.\n\nIn a certain sense, the function is the more natural form; it makes some intrinsic attributes of the function clearer. A striking example is the Taylor series of in 1:\n\nwith denoting the Riemann zeta function at .\n\nSo, using the following property:\nwe can find an integral representation for the function:\n\nor, setting and calculating :\n\nThe integral\n\ncan be expressed in terms of the Barnes -function (see Barnes -function for a proof):\n\nwhere .\n\nIt can also be written in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function:\n\nComplex values of the gamma function can be computed numerically with arbitrary precision using Stirling's approximation or the Lanczos approximation.\n\nThe gamma function can be computed to fixed precision for by applying integration by parts to Euler's integral. For any positive numberÂ  the gamma function can be written\n\nWhen and , the absolute value of the last integral is smaller than . By choosing a large enough , this last expression can be made smaller than for any desired valueÂ . Thus, the gamma function can be evaluated to bits of precision with the above series.\n\nThe only fast algorithm for calculation of the Euler gamma function for any algebraic argument (including rational) was constructed by E.A. Karatsuba,\n\nFor arguments that are integer multiples of , the gamma function can also be evaluated quickly using arithmetic-geometric mean iterations (see particular values of the gamma function).\n\nOne author describes the gamma function as \"Arguably, the most common special function, or the least 'special' of them. The other transcendental functions [â¦] are called 'special' because you could conceivably avoid some of them by staying away from many specialized mathematical topics. On the other hand, the gamma function is most difficult to avoid.\"\n\nThe gamma function finds application in such diverse areas as quantum physics, astrophysics and fluid dynamics. The gamma distribution, which is formulated in terms of the gamma function, is used in statistics to model a wide range of processes; for example, the time between occurrences of earthquakes.\n\nThe primary reason for the gamma function's usefulness in such contexts is the prevalence of expressions of the type which describe processes that decay exponentially in time or space. Integrals of such expressions can occasionally be solved in terms of the gamma function when no elementary solution exists. For example, if is a power function and is a linear function, a simple change of variables gives the evaluation\n\nThe fact that the integration is performed along the entire positive real line might signify that the gamma function describes the cumulation of a time-dependent process that continues indefinitely, or the value might be the total of a distribution in an infinite space.\n\nIt is of course frequently useful to take limits of integration other than 0 and to describe the cumulation of a finite process, in which case the ordinary gamma function is no longer a solution; the solution is then called an incomplete gamma function. (The ordinary gamma function, obtained by integrating across the entire positive real line, is sometimes called the \"complete gamma function\" for contrast.)\n\nAn important category of exponentially decaying functions is that of Gaussian functions\nand integrals thereof, such as the error function. There are many interrelations between these functions and the gamma function; notably, obtained by evaluating is the \"same\" as that found in the normalizing factor of the error function and the normal distribution.\n\nThe integrals we have discussed so far involve transcendental functions, but the gamma function also arises from integrals of purely algebraic functions. In particular, the arc lengths of ellipses and of the lemniscate, which are curves defined by algebraic equations, are given by elliptic integrals that in special cases can be evaluated in terms of the gamma function. The gamma function can also be used to calculate \"volume\" and \"area\" of -dimensional hyperspheres.\n\nAnother important special case is that of the beta function\n\nThe gamma function's ability to generalize factorial products immediately leads to applications in many areas of mathematics; in combinatorics, and by extension in areas such as probability theory and the calculation of power series. Many expressions involving products of successive integers can be written as some combination of factorials, the most important example perhaps being that of the binomial coefficient\n\nThe example of binomial coefficients motivates why the properties of the gamma function when extended to negative numbers are natural. A binomial coefficient gives the number of ways to choose elements from a set of elements; if , there are of course no ways. If , is the factorial of a negative integer and hence infinite if we use the gamma function definition of factorials â dividing by infinity gives the expected value of 0.\n\nWe can replace the factorial by a gamma function to extend any such formula to the complex numbers. Generally, this works for any product wherein each factor is a rational function of the index variable, by factoring the rational function into linear expressions. If and are monic polynomials of degree and with respective roots and , we have\n\nIf we have a way to calculate the gamma function numerically, it is a breeze to calculate numerical values of such products. The number of gamma functions in the right-hand side depends only on the degree of the polynomials, so it does not matter whether equals 5 or 10. Moreover, due to the poles of the gamma function, the equation also holds (in the sense of taking limits) when the left-hand product contain zeros or poles.\n\nBy taking limits, certain rational products with infinitely many factors can be evaluated in terms of the gamma function as well. Due to the Weierstrass factorization theorem, analytic functions can be written as infinite products, and these can sometimes be represented as finite products or quotients of the gamma function. We have already seen one striking example: the reflection formula essentially represents the sine function as the product of two gamma functions. Starting from this formula, the exponential function as well as all the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions can be expressed in terms of the gamma function.\n\nMore functions yet, including the hypergeometric function and special cases thereof, can be represented by means of complex contour integrals of products and quotients of the gamma function, called Mellin-Barnes integrals.\n\nAn elegant and deep application of the gamma function is in the study of the Riemann zeta function. A fundamental property of the Riemann zeta function is its functional equation:\n\nAmong other things, this provides an explicit form for the analytic continuation of the zeta function to a meromorphic function in the complex plane and leads to an immediate proof that the zeta function has infinitely many so-called \"trivial\" zeros on the real line. Borwein \"et al\". call this formula \"one of the most beautiful findings in mathematics\". Another champion for that title might be\n\nBoth formulas were derived by Bernhard Riemann in his seminal 1859 paper \"\"Ãber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen GrÃ¶Ãe\"\" (\"On the Number of Prime Numbers less than a Given Quantity\"), one of the milestones in the development of analytic number theory â the branch of mathematics that studies prime numbers using the tools of mathematical analysis. Factorial numbers, considered as discrete objects, are an important concept in classical number theory because they contain many prime factors, but Riemann found a use for their continuous extension that arguably turned out to be even more important.\n\nThe gamma function has caught the interest of some of the most prominent mathematicians of all time. Its history, notably documented by Philip J. Davis in an article that won him the 1963 Chauvenet Prize, reflects many of the major developments within mathematics since the 18th century. In the words of Davis, \"each generation has found something of interest to say about the gamma function. Perhaps the next generation will also.\"\n\nThe problem of extending the factorial to non-integer arguments was apparently first considered by Daniel Bernoulli and Christian Goldbach in the 1720s, and was solved at the end of the same decade by Leonhard Euler. Euler gave two different definitions: the first was not his integral but an infinite product,\n\nof which he informed Goldbach in a letter dated October 13, 1729. He wrote to Goldbach again on January 8, 1730, to announce his discovery of the integral representation\n\nwhich is valid for . By the change of variables , this becomes the familiar Euler integral. Euler published his results in the paper \"De progressionibus transcendentibus seu quarum termini generales algebraice dari nequeunt\" (\"On transcendental progressions, that is, those whose general terms cannot be given algebraically\"), submitted to the St. Petersburg Academy on November 28, 1729. Euler further discovered some of the gamma function's important functional properties, including the reflection formula.\n\nJames Stirling, a contemporary of Euler, also attempted to find a continuous expression for the factorial and came up with what is now known as Stirling's formula. Although Stirling's formula gives a good estimate of , also for non-integers, it does not provide the exact value. Extensions of his formula that correct the error were given by Stirling himself and by Jacques Philippe Marie Binet.\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss rewrote Euler's product as\n\nand used this formula to discover new properties of the gamma function. Although Euler was a pioneer in the theory of complex variables, he does not appear to have considered the factorial of a complex number, as instead Gauss first did. Gauss also proved the multiplication theorem of the gamma function and investigated the connection between the gamma function and elliptic integrals.\n\nKarl Weierstrass further established the role of the gamma function in complex analysis, starting from yet another product representation,\n\nwhere is the EulerâMascheroni constant. Weierstrass originally wrote his product as one for , in which case it is taken over the function's zeros rather than its poles. Inspired by this result, he proved what is known as the Weierstrass factorization theoremâthat any entire function can be written as a product over its zeros in the complex plane; a generalization of the fundamental theorem of algebra.\n\nThe name gamma function and the symbol were introduced by Adrien-Marie Legendre around 1811; Legendre also rewrote Euler's integral definition in its modern form. Although the symbol is an upper-case Greek gamma, there is no accepted standard for whether the function name should be written \"gamma function\" or \"Gamma function\" (some authors simply write \"-function\"). The alternative \"pi function\" notation due to Gauss is sometimes encountered in older literature, but Legendre's notation is dominant in modern works.\n\nIt is justified to ask why we distinguish between the \"ordinary factorial\" and the gamma function by using distinct symbols, and particularly why the gamma function should be normalized to instead of simply using \"\". Consider that the notation for exponents, , has been generalized from integers to complex numbers without any change. Legendre's motivation for the normalization does not appear to be known, and has been criticized as cumbersome by some (the 20th-century mathematician Cornelius Lanczos, for example, called it \"void of any rationality\" and would instead use ). Legendre's normalization does simplify a few formulae, but complicates most others. From a modern point of view, the Legendre normalization of the Gamma function is the integral of the additive character against the multiplicative character with respect to the Haar measure formula_78 on the Lie group . Thus this normalization makes it clearer that the gamma function is a continuous analogue of a Gauss sum.\n\nIt is somewhat problematic that a large number of definitions have been given for the gamma function. Although they describe the same function, it is not entirely straightforward to prove the equivalence. Stirling never proved that his extended formula corresponds exactly to Euler's gamma function; a proof was first given by Charles Hermite in 1900. Instead of finding a specialized proof for each formula, it would be desirable to have a general method of identifying the gamma function.\n\nOne way to prove would be to find a differential equation that characterizes the gamma function. Most special functions in applied mathematics arise as solutions to differential equations, whose solutions are unique. However, the gamma function does not appear to satisfy any simple differential equation. Otto HÃ¶lder proved in 1887 that the gamma function at least does not satisfy any \"algebraic\" differential equation by showing that a solution to such an equation could not satisfy the gamma function's recurrence formula, making it a transcendentally transcendental function. This result is known as HÃ¶lder's theorem.\n\nA definite and generally applicable characterization of the gamma function was not given until 1922. Harald Bohr and Johannes Mollerup then proved what is known as the \"BohrâMollerup theorem\": that the gamma function is the unique solution to the factorial recurrence relation that is positive and \"logarithmically convex\" for positive and whose value at 1 is 1 (a function is logarithmically convex if its logarithm is convex).\n\nThe BohrâMollerup theorem is useful because it is relatively easy to prove logarithmic convexity for any of the different formulas used to define the gamma function. Taking things further, instead of defining the gamma function by any particular formula, we can choose the conditions of the BohrâMollerup theorem as the definition, and then pick any formula we like that satisfies the conditions as a starting point for studying the gamma function. This approach was used by the Bourbaki group.\n\nAlthough the gamma function can be calculated virtually as easily as any mathematically simpler function with a modern computerâeven with a programmable pocket calculatorâthis was of course not always the case. Until the mid-20th century, mathematicians relied on hand-made tables; in the case of the gamma function, notably a table computed by Gauss in 1813 and one computed by Legendre in 1825.\n\nTables of complex values of the gamma function, as well as hand-drawn graphs, were given in \"Tables of Higher Functions\" by Jahnke and Emde, first published in Germany in 1909. According to Michael Berry, \"the publication in J&E of a three-dimensional graph showing the poles of the gamma function in the complex plane acquired an almost iconic status.\"\n\nThere was in fact little practical need for anything but real values of the gamma function until the 1930s, when applications for the complex gamma function were discovered in theoretical physics. As electronic computers became available for the production of tables in the 1950s, several extensive tables for the complex gamma function were published to meet the demand, including a table accurate to 12 decimal places from the U.S. National Bureau of Standards.\n\n\"Abramowitz and Stegun\" became the standard reference for this and many other special functions after its publication in 1964.\n\nDouble-precision floating-point implementations of the gamma function and its logarithm are now available in most scientific computing software and special functions libraries, for example TK Solver, Matlab, GNU Octave, and the GNU Scientific Library. The gamma function was also added to the C standard library (math.h). Arbitrary-precision implementations are available in most computer algebra systems, such as Mathematica and Maple. PARI/GP, MPFR and MPFUN contain free arbitrary-precision implementations.\n\n\n", "id": "12316", "title": "Gamma function"}

His most important contributions to the history of art were in his alliance with Fauvism from 1906, and the role he played in the development of Cubism. Braqueâs work between 1908 and 1912 is closely associated with that of his colleague Pablo Picasso. Their respective Cubist works were indistinguishable for many years, yet the quiet nature of Braque was partially eclipsed by the fame and notoriety of Picasso.\n\nGeorges Braque was born on 13 May 1882 in Argenteuil, Val-d'Oise. He grew up in Le Havre and trained to be a house painter and decorator like his father and grandfather. However, he also studied artistic painting during evenings at the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts, in Le Havre, from about 1897 to 1899. In Paris, he apprenticed with a decorator and was awarded his certificate in 1902. The next year, he attended the AcadÃ©mie Humbert, also in Paris, and painted there until 1904. It was here that he met Marie Laurencin and Francis Picabia.\n\nBraque's earliest works were impressionistic, but after seeing the work exhibited by the artistic group known as the \"Fauves\" (Beasts) in 1905, he adopted a Fauvist style. The Fauves, a group that included Henri Matisse and AndrÃ© Derain among others, used brilliant colors to represent emotional response. Braque worked most closely with the artists Raoul Dufy and Othon Friesz, who shared Braque's hometown of Le Havre, to develop a somewhat more subdued Fauvist style. In 1906, Braque traveled with Friesz to L'Estaque, to Antwerp, and home to Le Havre to paint.\n\nIn May 1907, he successfully exhibited works of the Fauve style in the Salon des IndÃ©pendants. The same year, Braque's style began a slow evolution as he became influenced by Paul CÃ©zanne who had died in 1906 and whose works were exhibited in Paris for the first time in a large-scale, museum-like retrospective in September 1907. The 1907 CÃ©zanne retrospective at the Salon d'Automne greatly affected the avant-garde artists of Paris, resulting in the advent of Cubism.\n\nBraque's paintings of 1908â1912 reflected his new interest in geometry and simultaneous perspective. He conducted an intense study of the effects of light and perspective and the technical means that painters use to represent these effects, seeming to question the most standard of artistic conventions. In his village scenes, for example, Braque frequently reduced an architectural structure to a geometric form approximating a cube, yet rendered its shading so that it looked both flat and three-dimensional by fragmenting the image. He showed this in the painting \"Houses at l'Estaque\".\n\nBeginning in 1909, Braque began to work closely with Pablo Picasso who had been developing a similar proto-Cubist style of painting. At the time, Pablo Picasso was influenced by Gauguin, CÃ©zanne, African masks and Iberian sculpture while Braque was interested mainly in developing CÃ©zanne's ideas of multiple perspectives. âA comparison of the works of Picasso and Braque during 1908 reveals that the effect of his encounter with Picasso was more to accelerate and intensify Braqueâs exploration of CÃ©zanneâs ideas, rather than to divert his thinking in any essential way.â Braqueâs essential subject is the ordinary objects he has known practically forever. Picasso celebrates animation, while Braque celebrates contemplation. Thus, the invention of Cubism was a joint effort between Picasso and Braque, then residents of Montmartre, Paris. These artists were the style's main innovators. After meeting in October or November 1907, Braque and Picasso, in particular, began working on the development of Cubism in 1908. Both artists produced paintings of monochromatic color and complex patterns of faceted form, now termed Analytic Cubism.\n\nA decisive time of its development occurred during the summer of 1911, when Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso painted side by side in CÃ©ret in the French Pyrenees, each artist producing paintings that are difficultâsometimes virtually impossibleâto distinguish from those of the other. In 1912, they began to experiment with collage and Braque invented the \"papier collÃ©\" technique.\n\nFrench art critic Louis Vauxcelles used the terms \"bizarre cubiques\" in 1908 after seeing a picture by Braque. He described it as 'full of little cubes'. The term 'Cubism', first pronounced in 1911 with reference to artists exhibiting at the Salon des IndÃ©pendants, quickly gained wide use but Picasso and Braque did not adopt it initially. Art historian Ernst Gombrich described Cubism as \"the most radical attempt to stamp out ambiguity and to enforce one reading of the pictureâthat of a man-made construction, a colored canvas.\" The Cubist style spread quickly throughout Paris and then Europe.\n\nThe two artists' productive collaboration continued and they worked closely together until the beginning of World War I in 1914, when Braque enlisted with the French Army. In May 1915, Braque received a severe head injury in battle at Carency and suffered temporary blindness. He was trepanned, and required a long period of recuperation.\n\nBraque resumed painting in late 1916. Working alone, he began to moderate the harsh abstraction of cubism. He developed a more personal style characterized by brilliant color, textured surfaces, andâafter his relocation to the Normandy seacoastâthe reappearance of the human figure. He painted many still life subjects during this time, maintaining his emphasis on structure. One example of this is his 1943 work \"Blue Guitar\", which hangs in the Allen Memorial Art Museum. During his recovery he became a close friend of the cubist artist Juan Gris.\n\nHe continued to work during the remainder of his life, producing a considerable number of paintings, graphics, and sculptures. Braque, along with Matisse, is credited for introducing Pablo Picasso to Fernand Mourlot, and most of the lithographs and book illustrations he himself created during the 1940s and '50s were produced at the Mourlot Studios. In 1962 Braque worked with master printmaker Aldo Crommelynck to create his series of etchings and aquatints titled \"LâOrdre des Oiseaux\" (\"The Order of Birds\"), which was accompanied by the poet Saint-John Perse's text.\n\nBraque died on 31 August 1963 in Paris. He is buried in the cemetery of the Church of St. Valery in Varengeville-sur-Mer, Normandy whose windows he designed. Braque's work is in most major museums throughout the world.\n\nBraque believed that an artist experienced beauty \"â¦ in terms of volume, of line, of mass, of weight, and through that beauty [he] interpret[s] [his] subjective impression...â He described \"objects shattered into fragmentsâ¦ [as] a way of getting closest to the objectâ¦Fragmentation helped me to establish space and movement in spaceâ. He adopted a monochromatic and neutral color palette in the belief that such a palette would emphasize the subject matter.\n\nAlthough Braque began his career painting landscapes, during 1908 he, alongside Picasso, discovered the advantages of painting still lifes instead. Braque explained that he\nââ¦ began to concentrate on still-lifes, because in the still-life you have a tactile, I might almost say a manual spaceâ¦ This answered to the hankering I have always had to touch things and not merely see themâ¦ In tactile space you measure the distance separating you from the object, whereas in visual space you measure the distance separating things from each other. This is what led me, long ago, from landscape to still-lifeâ A still life was also more accessible, in relation to perspective, than landscape, and permitted the artist to see the multiple perspectives of the object. Braque's early interest in still lifes revived during the 1930s.\n\nDuring the period between the wars, Braque exhibited a freer style of Cubism, intensifying his color use and a looser rendering of objects. However, he still remained committed to the cubist method of simultaneous perspective and fragmentation. In contrast to Picasso, who continuously reinvented his style of painting, producing both representational and cubist images, and incorporating surrealist ideas into his work, Braque continued in the Cubist style, producing luminous, other-worldly still life and figure compositions. By the time of his death in 1963, he was regarded as one of the elder statesmen of the School of Paris, and of modern art.\n\nOn 20 May 2010, the MusÃ©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris reported the overnight theft of five paintings from its collection. The paintings taken were \"Le pigeon aux petits pois\" (\"The Pigeon with the Peas\") by Pablo Picasso, \"La Pastorale\" by Henri Matisse, \"L'Olivier PrÃ¨s de l'Estaque\" (\"Olive Tree near Estaque\") by Georges Braque, \"\" (\"Woman with a Fan\") by Amedeo Modigliani and \"Nature Morte aux Chandeliers\" (\"Still Life with Chandeliers\") by Fernand LÃ©ger and were valued at (Â ). A window had been smashed and CCTV footage showed a masked man taking the paintings. Authorities believe the thief acted alone. The man carefully removed the paintings from their frames, which he left behind.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12317", "title": "Georges Braque"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12323", "text": "GNU Compiler Collection\n\nThe GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a compiler system produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages. GCC is a key component of the GNU toolchain and the standard compiler for most Unix-like Operating Systems. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) distributes GCC under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). GCC has played an important role in the growth of free software, as both a tool and an example.\n\nOriginally named the GNU C Compiler, when it only handled the C programming language, GCC 1.0 was released in 1987. It was extended to compile C++ in December of that year. Front ends were later developed for Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran, Java, Ada, and Go among others.\n\nVersion 4.5 of the OpenMP specification is now supported in the C and C++ compilers and a \"much improved\" implementation of the OpenACC 2.0a specification is also supported. By default, the current version supports \"gnu++14\", a superset of C++14 and \"gnu11\", a superset of C11, with strict standard support also available. It also provides experimental support for C++17 and later.\n\nGCC has been ported to a wide variety of processor architectures, and is widely deployed as a tool in the development of both free and proprietary software. GCC is also available for most embedded systems, including ARM-based; AMCC, and Freescale Power Architecture-based chips. The compiler can target a wide variety of platforms.\n\nAs well as being the official compiler of the GNU operating system, GCC has been adopted as the standard compiler by many other modern Unix-like computer operating systems, including Linux and the BSD family, although FreeBSD and macOS have moved to the LLVM system. Versions are also available for Microsoft Windows and other operating systems; GCC can compile code for Android and iOS.\n\nIn an effort to bootstrap the GNU operating system, Richard Stallman asked Andrew S. Tanenbaum, the author of the Amsterdam Compiler Kit (also known as the \"Free University\" Compiler Kit) if he could use that software for GNU. When Tanenbaum told him that while the \"Free University\" was free, the compiler was not, Stallman decided to write his own. Stallman's initial plan was to rewrite an existing compiler from Lawrence Livermore Laboratory from Pastel to C with some help from Len Tower and others. Stallman wrote a new C front end for the Livermore compiler, but then realized that it required megabytes of stack space, an impossibility on a 68000 Unix system with only 64Â KB, and concluded he would have to write a new compiler from scratch. None of the Pastel compiler code ended up in GCC, though Stallman did use the C front end he had written.\n\nGCC was first released March 22, 1987, available by FTP from MIT. Stallman was listed as the author but cited others for their contributions, including Jack Davidson and Christopher Fraser for the idea of using RTL as an intermediate language, Paul Rubin for writing most of the preprocessor and Leonard Tower for \"parts of the parser, RTL generator, RTL definitions, and of the Vax machine description.\" Described as the \"first free software hit\" by Salus, the GNU compiler arrived just at the time when Sun Microsystems was unbundling its development tools from its operating system, selling them separately at a higher combined price than the previous bundle, which led many of Sun's users to buy or download GCC instead of the vendor's tools. By 1990, GCC supported thirteen computer architectures, was outperforming several vendor compilers, was shipped by Data General and NeXT with their workstations and was used by Lotus Development Corporation.\n\nAs GCC was licensed under the GPL, programmers wanting to work in other directionsâparticularly those writing interfaces for languages other than Câwere free to develop their own fork of the compiler, provided they meet the GPL's terms, including its requirements to distribute source code. Multiple forks proved inefficient and unwieldy, however, and the difficulty in getting work accepted by the official GCC project was greatly frustrating for many. The FSF kept such close control on what was added to the official version of GCC 2.x that GCC was used as one example of the \"cathedral\" development model in Eric S. Raymond's essay \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\".\n\nIn 1997, a group of developers formed Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System (EGCS) to merge several experimental forks into a single project. The basis of the merger was a GCC development snapshot taken between the 2.7 and 2.81 releases. Projects merged included g77 (Fortran), PGCC (P5 Pentium-optimized GCC), many C++ improvements, and many new architectures and operating system variants. EGCS development proved considerably more vigorous than GCC development, so much so that the FSF officially halted development on their GCC 2.x compiler, blessed EGCS as the official version of GCC and appointed the EGCS project as the GCC maintainers in April 1999. With the release of GCC 2.95 in July 1999 the two projects were once again united.\n\nGCC has since been maintained by a varied group of programmers from around the world under the direction of a steering committee. It has been ported to more kinds of processors and operating systems than any other compiler.\n\nGCC has been ported to a wide variety of processor architectures, and is widely deployed as a tool in the development of both free and proprietary software. GCC is also available for most embedded systems, including Symbian (called \"gcce\"), ARM-based; AMCC, and Freescale Power Architecture-based chips. The compiler can target a wide variety of platforms, including video game consoles such as the PlayStation 2, Cell SPE of PlayStation 3 and Dreamcast.\n\nGCC's external interface follows Unix conventions. Users invoke a language-specific driver program (codice_1 for C, codice_2 for C++, etc.), which interprets command arguments, calls the actual compiler, runs the assembler on the output, and then optionally runs the linker to produce a complete executable binary.\n\nEach of the language compilers is a separate program that reads source code and outputs machine code. All have a common internal structure. A per-language front end parses the source code in that language and produces an abstract syntax tree (\"tree\" for short).\n\nThese are, if necessary, converted to the middle end's input representation, called \"GENERIC\" form; the middle end then gradually transforms the program towards its final form. Compiler optimizations and static code analysis techniques (such as FORTIFY_SOURCE, a compiler directive that attempts to discover some buffer overflows) are applied to the code. These work on multiple representations, mostly the architecture-independent GIMPLE representation and the architecture-dependent RTL representation. Finally, machine code is produced using architecture-specific pattern matching originally based on an algorithm of Jack Davidson and Chris Fraser.\n\nGCC was written primarily in C except for parts of the Ada front end. The distribution includes the standard libraries for Ada, C++, and Java whose code is mostly written in those languages. On some platforms, the distribution also includes a low-level runtime library, libgcc, written in a combination of machine-independent C and processor-specific machine code, designed primarily to handle arithmetic operations that the target processor cannot perform directly.\n\nIn May 2010, the GCC steering committee decided to allow use of a C++ compiler to compile GCC. The compiler was intended to be written in C plus a subset of features from C++. In particular, this was decided so that GCC's developers could use the destructors and generics features of C++.\n\nIn August 2012, the GCC steering committee announced that GCC now uses C++ as its implementation language. This means that to build GCC from sources, a C++ compiler is required that understands ISO/IEC C++03 standard.\n\nEach front end uses a parser to produce the abstract syntax tree of a given source file. Due to the syntax tree abstraction, source files of any of the different supported languages can be processed by the same back end. GCC started out using LALR parsers generated with Bison, but gradually switched to hand-written recursive-descent parsers; for C++ in 2004, and for C and Objective-C in 2006. Currently all front ends use hand-written recursive-descent parsers.\n\nUntil recently, the tree representation of the program was not fully independent of the processor being targeted.\n\nThe meaning of a tree was somewhat different for different language front ends, and front ends could provide their own tree codes. This was simplified with the introduction of GENERIC and GIMPLE, two new forms of language-independent trees that were introduced with the advent of GCC 4.0. GENERIC is more complex, based on the GCC 3.x Java front end's intermediate representation. GIMPLE is a simplified GENERIC, in which various constructs are \"lowered\" to multiple GIMPLE instructions. The C, C++ and Java front ends produce GENERIC directly in the front end. Other front ends instead have different intermediate representations after parsing and convert these to GENERIC.\n\nIn either case, the so-called \"gimplifier\" then converts this more complex form into the simpler SSA-based GIMPLE form that is the common language for a large number of powerful language- and architecture-independent global (function scope) optimizations.\n\n\"GENERIC\" is an intermediate representation language used as a \"middle end\" while compiling source code into executable binaries. A subset, called \"GIMPLE\", is targeted by all the front ends of GCC.\n\nThe middle stage of GCC does all of the code analysis and optimization, working independently of both the compiled language and the target architecture, starting from the GENERIC representation and expanding it to register transfer language (RTL). The GENERIC representation contains only the subset of the imperative programming constructs optimized by the middle end.\n\nIn transforming the source code to GIMPLE, complex expressions are split into a three-address code using temporary variables. This representation was inspired by the SIMPLE representation proposed in the McCAT compiler by Laurie J. Hendren for simplifying the analysis and optimization of imperative programs.\n\nOptimization can occur during any phase of compilation; however, the bulk of optimizations are performed after the syntax and semantic analysis of the front end and before the code generation of the back end; thus a common, even though somewhat contradictory, name for this part of the compiler is the \"middle end.\"\n\nThe exact set of GCC optimizations varies from release to release as it develops, but includes the standard algorithms, such as loop optimization, jump threading, common subexpression elimination, instruction scheduling, and so forth. The RTL optimizations are of less importance with the addition of global SSA-based optimizations on GIMPLE trees, as RTL optimizations have a much more limited scope, and have less high-level information.\n\nSome of these optimizations performed at this level include dead code elimination, partial redundancy elimination, global value numbering, sparse conditional constant propagation, and scalar replacement of aggregates. Array dependence based optimizations such as automatic vectorization and automatic parallelization are also performed. Profile-guided optimization is also possible.\n\nThe behavior of GCC's back end is partly specified by preprocessor macros and functions specific to a target architecture, for instance to define its endianness, word size, and calling conventions. The front part of the back end uses these to help decide RTL generation, so although GCC's RTL is nominally processor-independent, the initial sequence of abstract instructions is already adapted to the target. At any moment, the actual RTL instructions forming the program representation have to comply with the machine description of the target architecture.\n\nThe machine description file contains RTL patterns, along with operand constraints, and code snippets to output the final assembly. The constraints indicate that a particular RTL pattern might only apply (for example) to certain hardware registers, or (for example) allow immediate operand offsets of only a limited size (\"e.g.\" 12, 16, 24, â¦ bit offsets, etc.). During RTL generation, the constraints for the given target architecture are checked. In order to issue a given snippet of RTL, it must match one (or more) of the RTL patterns in the machine description file, and satisfy the constraints for that pattern; otherwise, it would be impossible to convert the final RTL into machine code.\n\nTowards the end of compilation, valid RTL is reduced to a \"strict\" form in which each instruction refers to real machine registers and a pattern from the target's machine description file. Forming strict RTL is a complicated task; an important step is register allocation, where real hardware registers are chosen to replace the initially assigned pseudo-registers. This is followed by a \"reloading\" phase; any pseudo-registers that were not assigned a real hardware register are 'spilled' to the stack, and RTL to perform this spilling is generated. Likewise, offsets that are too large to fit into an actual instruction must be broken up and replaced by RTL sequences that will obey the offset constraints.\n\nIn the final phase, the machine code is built by calling a small snippet of code, associated with each pattern, to generate the real instructions from the target's instruction set, using the final registers, offsets, and addresses chosen during the reload phase. The assembly-generation snippet may be just a string, in which case a simple string substitution of the registers, offsets, and/or addresses into the string is performed. The assembly-generation snippet may also be a short block of C code, performing some additional work, but ultimately returning a string containing the valid assembly code.\n\nSome features of GCC include:\n\n\nThe standard compiler releases since 4.6 include front ends for C (gcc), C++ (g++), Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran (gfortran), Java (gcj), Ada (GNAT), and Go (gccgo). A popular parallel language extension, OpenMP, is also supported. Version 5.0 added support for Cilk Plus, and since version 5.1, there is preliminary support for OpenACC.\n\nThe Fortran front end was g77 before version 4.0, which only supports FORTRAN 77. In newer versions, g77 is dropped in favor of the new GNU Fortran front end (retaining most of g77's language extensions) that supports Fortran 95 and large parts of Fortran 2003 and Fortran 2008 as well. A front-end for CHILL was dropped due to a lack of maintenance.\n\nThird-party front ends exist for Pascal (gpc), Modula-2, Modula-3, PL/I, D (gdc), and VHDL (ghdl).\n\nA few experimental branches exist to support additional languages, such as the GCC UPC compiler for Unified Parallel C.\n\nGCC target processor families as of version 4.3 include:\nLesser-known target processors supported in the standard release have included:\nAdditional processors have been supported by GCC versions maintained separately from the FSF version:\nThe gcj Java compiler can target either a native machine language architecture or the Java virtual machine's Java bytecode. When retargeting GCC to a new platform, bootstrapping is often used.\n\nThe current stable version of GCC is 6.3, which was released on December 21, 2016.\n\nAs of version 4.8, GCC is implemented in C++.\n\nGCC 4.6 supports many new Objective-C features, such as declared and synthesized properties, dot syntax, fast enumeration, optional protocol methods, method/protocol/class attributes, class extensions and a new GNU Objective-C runtime API. It also supports the Go programming language and includes the codice_3 library, which provides quadruple-precision mathematical functions on targets supporting the codice_4 datatype. The library is used to provide the codice_5 type in GNU Fortran on such targets.\n\nGCC uses many standard tools in its build, including Perl, Flex, Bison, and other common tools. In addition it currently requires three additional libraries to be present in order to build: GMP, MPC, and MPFR.\n\nThe trunk concentrates the major part of the development efforts, where new features are implemented and tested.\n\nBy default GCC uses the GNU C library (glibc), while musl, an alternative (for Linux and Android with Bionic) C library, is also officially supported \"for the AArch64, ARM, MicroBlaze, MIPS, MIPS64, PowerPC, PowerPC64, SH, i386, x32 and x86_64 targets. [..] GCC defaults to musl libc if it is built with a target triplet matching the *-linux-musl* pattern.\"\n\nThe \"GCC runtime exception\" permits compilation of proprietary and free software programs with GCC and usage of free software plugins. The availability of this exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.\n\nSeveral companies make a business out of supplying and supporting GCC ports to various platforms.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12323", "title": "GNU Compiler Collection"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12326", "text": "Galen\n\nAelius Galenus or Claudius Galenus (; ; September 129 AD â /), often Anglicized as Galen and better known as Galen of Pergamon (), was a prominent Greek physician, surgeon and philosopher in the Roman Empire. Arguably the most accomplished of all medical researchers of antiquity, Galen influenced the development of various scientific disciplines, including anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and neurology, as well as philosophy and logic.\n\nThe son of Aelius Nicon, a wealthy architect with scholarly interests, Galen received a comprehensive education that prepared him for a successful career as a physician and philosopher. Born in Pergamon (present-day Bergama, Turkey), Galen traveled extensively, exposing himself to a wide variety of medical theories and discoveries before settling in Rome, where he served prominent members of Roman society and eventually was given the position of personal physician to several emperors.\n\nGalen's understanding of anatomy and medicine was principally influenced by the then-current theory of humorism (also known as the four humors â black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm), as advanced by ancient Greek physicians such as Hippocrates. His theories dominated and influenced Western medical science for more than 1,300 years. His anatomical reports, based mainly on dissection of monkeys, especially the Barbary macaque, and pigs, remained uncontested until 1543, when printed descriptions and illustrations of human dissections were published in the seminal work \"De humani corporis fabrica\" by Andreas Vesalius where Galen's physiological theory was accommodated to these new observations. Galen's theory of the physiology of the circulatory system endured until 1628, when William Harvey published his treatise entitled \"De motu cordis\", in which he established that blood circulates, with the heart acting as a pump. Medical students continued to study Galen's writings until well into the 19th century. Galen conducted many nerve ligation experiments that supported the theory, which is still accepted today, that the brain controls all the motions of the muscles by means of the cranial and peripheral nervous systems.\n\nGalen saw himself as both a physician and a philosopher, as he wrote in his treatise entitled \"That the Best Physician is Also a Philosopher\". Galen was very interested in the debate between the rationalist and empiricist medical sects, and his use of direct observation, dissection and vivisection represents a complex middle ground between the extremes of those two viewpoints. Many of his works have been preserved and/or translated from the original Greek, although many were destroyed and some credited to him are believed to be spurious. Although there is some debate over the date of his death, he was no younger than seventy when he died.\n\nIn medieval Europe, Galen's writings on anatomy became the mainstay of the medieval physician's university curriculum, but by that time they suffered greatly from stasis and intellectual stagnation. Some of Galen's ideas were incorrect: he did not dissect a human body, nor did the medieval lecturers.\n\nGalen's original Greek texts gained renewed prominence during the early modern period. In the 1530s, Belgian anatomist and physician Andreas Vesalius took on a project to translate many of Galen's Greek texts into Latin. Vesalius's most famous work, \"De humani corporis fabrica\", was greatly influenced by Galenic writing and form.\n\nGalen's name , \"GalÄnos\" comes from the adjective \"\", \"calm\".\n\nGalen describes his early life in \"On the affections of the mind\". He was born in September AD 129 ; his father, Aelius Nicon, was a wealthy patrician, an architect and builder, with eclectic interests including philosophy, mathematics, logic, astronomy, agriculture and literature. Galen describes his father as a \"highly amiable, just, good and benevolent man\". At that time Pergamon (modern-day Bergama, Turkey) was a major cultural and intellectual centre, noted for its library, second only to that in Alexandria,\nand attracted both Stoic and Platonic philosophers, to whom Galen was exposed at age 14. His studies also took in each of the principal philosophical systems of the time, including Aristotelian and Epicurean. His father had planned a traditional career for Galen in philosophy or politics and took care to expose him to literary and philosophical influences. However, Galen states that in around AD 145 his father had a dream in which the god Asclepius (Aesculapius) appeared and commanded Nicon to send his son to study medicine. Again, no expense was spared, and following his earlier liberal education, at 16 he began studies at the prestigious local sanctuary or Asclepieum dedicated to Asclepius, god of medicine, as a Î¸ÎµÏÎ±ÏÎµÏÏÎ®Ï (\"therapeutes\", or attendant) for four years. There he came under the influence of men like Aeschrion of Pergamon, Stratonicus and Satyrus. Asclepiea functioned as spas or sanitoria to which the sick would come to seek the ministrations of the priesthood. Romans frequented the temple at Pergamon in search of medical relief from illness and disease. It was also the haunt of notable people such as Claudius Charax the historian, Aelius Aristides the orator, Polemo the sophist, and Cuspius Rufinus the Consul.\n\nIn 148, when he was 19, his father died, leaving him independently wealthy. He then followed the advice he found in Hippocrates' teaching and travelled and studied widely including such destinations as Smyrna (now Izmir), Corinth, Crete, Cilicia (now Ãukurova), Cyprus, and finally the great medical school of Alexandria, exposing himself to the various schools of thought in medicine. In 157, aged 28, he returned to Pergamon as physician to the gladiators of the High Priest of Asia, one of the most influential and wealthy men in Asia. Galen claims that the High Priest chose him over other physicians after he eviscerated an ape and challenged other physicians to repair the damage. When they refused, Galen performed the surgery himself and in so doing won the favor of the High Priest of Asia. Over his four years there he learned the importance of diet, fitness, hygiene and preventive measures, as well as living anatomy, and the treatment of fractures and severe trauma, referring to their wounds as \"windows into the body\". Only five deaths among the gladiators occurred while he held the post, compared to sixty in his predecessor's time, a result that is in general ascribed to the attention he paid to their wounds. At the same time he pursued studies in theoretical medicine and philosophy.\n\nGalen went to Rome in 162 and made his mark as a practicing physician. His impatience brought him into conflict with other doctors and he felt menaced by them. His demonstrations there antagonized the less skilled and more conservative physicians in the city. When Galen's animosity with the Roman medical practitioners became serious, he feared he might be exiled or poisoned, so he left the city.\n\nRome engaged in foreign wars in 161. Marcus Aurelius and his colleague Lucius Verus were in the north fighting the Marcomanni. During the autumn of 169 when Roman troops were returning to Aquileia, a great plague broke out, and the emperor summoned Galen back to Rome. He was ordered to accompany Marcus and Verus to Germany as the court physician. The following spring Marcus was persuaded to release Galen after receiving a report that Asclepius was against the project. He was left behind to act as physician to the imperial heir Commodus. It was here in court that Galen wrote extensively on medical subjects. Ironically, Lucius Verus died in 169, and Marcus Aurelius himself died in 180, both victims of the plague.\n\nGalen was the physician to Commodus for much of the emperorâs life and treated his common illnesses. According to Dio Cassius 72.14.3â4, in about 189, under Commodusâ reign, a pestilence occurred which at its height killed 2,000 people a day in Rome. This was most likely the same plague that struck Rome during Marcus Aureliusâ reign.\n\nGalen became physician to Septimius Severus during his reign in Rome. Galen compliments Severus and Caracalla on keeping a supply of drugs for their friends and mentions three cases in which they had been of use in 198.\n\nThe Antonine Plague was named after Marcus Aureliusâ family name of Antoninus. It was also known as the Plague of Galen and held an important place in medicinal history because of its association with Galen. He had first-hand knowledge of the disease, and was present in Rome when it first struck in 166 AD, and was also present in the winter of 168â69 during an outbreak among troops stationed at Aquileia. He had experience with the epidemic, referring to it as very long lasting, and described its symptoms and his treatment of it. Unfortunately, his references to the plague are scattered and brief. Galen was not trying to present a description of the disease so that it could be recognized in future generations; he was more interested in the treatment and physical effects of the disease. For example, in his writings about a young man afflicted with the plague, he concentrated on the treatment of internal and external ulcerations. According to Niebuhr, \"this pestilence must have raged with incredible fury; it carried off innumerable victims. The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted upon it by the plague that visited it in the reign of M. Aurelius.\"\nThe mortality rate of the plague was 7â10 percent; the outbreak in 165â168 would have caused approximately 3.5 to 5 million deaths. Otto Seeck believes that over half the population of the empire perished. J. F. Gilliam believes that the Antonine plague probably caused more deaths than any other epidemic during the empire before the mid-3rd century. It is believed that the Antonine Plague was smallpox, because though his description is incomplete, Galen gave enough information to enable a firm identification of the disease.\n\nGalen notes that the exanthema covered the victimâs entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby where there was no ulceration. He states that those that were going to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually in the form of a blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one Thucydides described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patientâs diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, catarrh, cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.\n\nWhen the Peripatetic philosopher Eudemus became ill with quartan fever, Galen felt obliged to treat him \"since he was my teacher and I happened to live nearby.\" Galen wrote: \"I return to the case of Eudemus. He was thoroughly attacked by the three attacks of quartan ague, and the doctors had given him up, as it was now mid-winter.\" Some Roman physicians criticized Galen for his use of the prognosis in his treatment of Eudemus. This practice conflicted with the then-current standard of care, which relied upon divination and mysticism. Galen retaliated against his detractors by defending his own methods. Garcia-Ballester quotes Galen as saying: \"In order to diagnose, one must observe and reason. This was the basis of his criticism of the doctors who proceeded alogos and askeptos.\" However, Eudemus warned Galen that engaging in conflict with these physicians could lead to his assassination. \"Eudemus said this, and more to the same effect; he added that if they were not able to harm me by unscrupulous conduct they would proceed to attempts at poisoning. Among other things he told me that, some ten years before, a young man had come to the city and had given, like me practical demonstrations of the resources of our art; this young man was put to death by poison, together with two servants who accompanied him.\"\n\nGarcia-Ballester says the following of Galenâs use of prognosis: \"In modern medicine, we are used to distinguishing between the diagnostic judgment (the scientific knowledge of what a patient has) and the prognostic judgment (the conjecture about what will happen to him.) Galen, like the Hippocratics, was not. For him, to understand a clinical case technically, âto diagnoseâ, was, among other things, to know with greater or lesser certainty the outcome for the patient, âto prognosticateâ. Prognosis, then, is one of the essential problems and most important objectives of Galenic diagnosis. Galen was concerned to distinguish it from divination or prophecy, both to improve diagnosis technically and to enhance the physicianâs reputation.\"\n\nThe 11th-century \"Suda\" lexicon states that Galen died at the age of 70, which would place his death in about the year 199. However, there is a reference in Galen's treatise \"\"On Theriac to Piso\"\" (which may, however, be spurious) to events of 204. There are also statements in Arabic sources that he died in Sicily at age 87, after 17 years studying medicine and 70 practicing it, which would mean he died about 217. According to these sources, the tomb of Galenus in Palermo was still well preserved in tenth century. Nutton believes that \"\"On Theriac to Piso\"\" is genuine, that the Arabic sources are correct, and that the \"Suda\" has erroneously interpreted the 70 years of Galen's career in the Arabic tradition as referring to his whole lifespan. Boudon-Millot more or less concurs and favours a date of 216.\n\nGalen contributed a substantial amount to the Hippocratic understanding of pathology. Under Hippocratesâ bodily humors theory, differences in human moods come as a consequence of imbalances in one of the four bodily fluids: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Galen promoted this theory and the typology of human temperaments. An imbalance of each humor corresponded with a particular human temperament (bloodâsanguine, black bileâmelancholic, yellow bileâcholeric, and phlegmâphlegmatic). Individuals with sanguine temperaments are extroverted and social. Choleric people have energy, passion, and charisma. Melancholics are creative, kind, and considerate. Phlegmatic temperaments are characterized by dependability, kindness, and affection.\n\nGalenâs principal interest was in human anatomy, but Roman law had prohibited the dissection of human cadavers since about 150 BC. Because of this restriction, Galen performed anatomical dissections on living (vivisection) and dead animals, mostly focusing on pigs and primates. This work was useful because Galen believed that the anatomical structures of these animals closely mirrored those of humans. Galen clarified the anatomy of the trachea and was the first to demonstrate that the larynx generates the voice. In one experiment Galen used bellows to inflate the lungs of a dead animal. Galen's work on the anatomy remained largely unsurpassed and unchallenged up until the 16th century in Europe. In the middle of the 16th Century, the anatomist Andreas Vesalius challenged the anatomical knowledge of Galen by conducting dissections on human cadavers. These investigations allowed Vesalius to refute aspects of Galen's anatomy.\n\nAmong Galenâs major contributions to medicine was his work on the circulatory system. He was the first to recognize that there are distinct differences between venous (dark) and arterial (bright) blood. Although his anatomical experiments on animal models led him to a more complete understanding of the circulatory system, nervous system, respiratory system, and other structures, his work contained scientific errors. Galen believed the circulatory system to consist of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single unified system of circulation. He believed venous blood to be generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the heart, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle. Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the rete mirabile in the carotid sinus. Both of these theories of the circulation of blood were later shown to be incorrect by Ibn al-Nafis.\n\nIn his work \"De motu musculorum\", Galen explained the difference between motor and sensory nerves, discussed the concept of muscle tone, and explained the difference between agonists and antagonists.\n\nGalen was a skilled surgeon, operating on human patients. Many of his procedures and techniques would not be used again for centuries, such as the procedures he performed on brains and eyes. To correct cataracts in patients, Galen performed an operation similar to a modern one. Using a needle-shaped instrument, Galen attempted to remove the cataract-affected lens of the eye. His surgical experiments included ligating the arteries of living animals. Although many 20th century historians have claimed that Galen believed the lens to be in the exact center of the eye, Galen actually understood that the crystalline lens is located in the anterior aspect of the human eye.\n\nAt first reluctantly but then with increasing vigour, Galen promoted Hippocratic teaching, including venesection and bloodletting, then unknown in Rome. This was sharply criticised by the Erasistrateans, who predicted dire outcomes, believing that it was not blood but \"pneuma\" that flowed in the veins. Galen, however, staunchly defended venesection in his three books on the subject and in his demonstrations and public disputations.\n\nAlthough the main focus of his work was on medicine, anatomy, and physiology, Galen also wrote about logic and philosophy. His writings were influenced by earlier Greek and Roman thinkers, including Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. Galen was concerned to combine philosophical thought with medical practice, as in his brief work \"That the Best Physician is also a Philosopher\". He took aspects from each group and combined them with his original thought. He regarded medicine as an interdisciplinary field that was best practiced by utilizing theory, observation, and experimentation in conjunction.\n\nSeveral schools of thought existed within the medical field during Galen's lifetime, the main two being the Empiricists and Rationalists (also called Dogmatists or Philosophers), with the Methodists being a smaller group. The Empiricists emphasized the importance of physical practice and experimentation, or \"active learning\" in the medical discipline. In direct opposition to the Empiricists were the Rationalists, who valued the study of established teachings in order to create new theories in the name of medical advancements. The Methodists formed somewhat of a middle ground, as they were not as experimental as the Empiricists, nor as theoretical as the Rationalists. The Methodists mainly utilized pure observation, showing greater interest in studying the natural course of ailments than making efforts to find remedies. Galen's education had exposed him to the four major schools of thought (Platonists, Peripatetics, Stoics, Epicureans), with teachers from the Rationalist sect and from the Empiricist sect.\n\nGalen was well known for his advancements in the medical field and the circulatory system; he was also quite involved with philosophy. He developed his own tripartite soul following the examples of Plato; some scholars reference him as a Platonist. Galen would not have agreed with this claim because he was primarily a scientist and all of his claims could be supported by scientific evidence; Plato was purely a philosopher. He also developed his own personality theory which was connected to liquids in the body and believed that there was a physiological basis for mental disorders. Lastly, he connected many of his theories to the pneuma, which is where he most strongly opposed the Stoics definition and use of the pneuma.\n\nThe Stoics, according to Galen, failed to give a credible answer for the localization of functions of the psyche, or the mind. Through his use of medicine, he was convinced that he came up with a better answer, the brain. The Stoics only recognized the soul as having one part, which was the rational soul and they claimed it would be found in the heart. Galen, following Plato's idea, came up with two more parts to the soul.\n\nGalen also rejected Stoic propositional logic and instead embraced a hypothetical syllogistic which was strongly influenced by the Peripatetics and based on elements of Aristotelian logic.\n\nOne of Galenâs major works, \"On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato\", sought to demonstrate the unity of the two subjects and their views. Using their theories, combined with Aristotle's, Galen developed a tripartite soul consisting of similar aspects. He used the same terms as Plato, referring to the three parts as rational, spiritual, and appetitive. Each corresponded to a localized area of the body. The rational soul was in the brain, the spiritual soul was in the heart, and the appetitive soul was in the liver. Galen was the first scientist and philosopher to assign specific parts of the soul to locations in the body because of his extensive background in medicine. This idea is now referred to as localization of function. Galenâs assignments were revolutionary for the time period, which set the precedent for future localization theories.\n\nGalen believed each part of this tripartite soul controlled specific functions within the body and that the soul, as a whole, contributed to the health of the body, strengthening the \"natural functioning capacity of the organ or organs in question\". The rational soul controlled higher level cognitive functioning in an organism, for example, making choices or perceiving the world and sending those signals to the brain. He also listed âimagination, memory, recollection, knowledge, thought, consideration, voluntary motion and sensation\" as being found within the rational soul. The functions of âgrowing or being aliveâ resided in the spirited soul. The spirited soul also contained our passions, such as anger. These passions were considered to be even stronger than regular emotions, and, as a consequence, more dangerous. The third part of the soul, or the appetitive spirit, controlled the living forces in our body, most importantly blood. The appetitive spirit also regulated the pleasures of the body and was moved by feelings of enjoyment. This third part of the soul is the animalistic, or more natural, side of the soul, it deals with the natural urges of the body and survival instincts. Galen proposed that when the soul is moved by too much enjoyment, it reaches states of âincontinenceâ and âlicentiousnessâ, the inability to willfully cease enjoyment, which was a negative consequence of too much pleasure.\n\nIn order to unite his theories about the soul and how it operated within the body, he adapted the theory of the pneuma, which he used to explain how the soul operated within its assigned organs, and how those organs, in turn, interacted together. Galen then distinguished the vital pneuma, in the arterial system, from the psychic pneuma, in the brain and nervous system. Galen placed the vital pneuma in the heart and the psychic pneuma within the brain. He conducted many anatomical studies on animals, most famously an ox, to study the transition from vital to psychic pneuma. Although highly criticized for comparing animal anatomy to human anatomy, Galen was convinced that his knowledge was abundant enough in both anatomies to base one off of the other.\n\nGalen believed there to be no distinction between the mental and the physical. This was a controversial argument of the time-period (mindâbody problem), and Galen fell with the Greeks in believing that the mind and body were not separate faculties. He also believed that this could be scientifically proven. This was where his opposition to the Stoics became most prevalent. Galen proposed organs within the body to be responsible for specific functions, rather than individual parts. According to Galen, the Stoics' lack of scientific justification discredited their claims of the separateness of mind and body, which is why he spoke so strongly against them.\n\nAnother one of Galen's major works, \"On the Diagnosis and Cure of the Soulâs Passion,\" contained how to approach and treat psychological problems. This was Galenâs early attempt at psychotherapy. His book contained directions on how to use what he called \"talk therapy\", or Psychotherapy, to prompt an individual to reveal their deepest passions and secrets, and eventually cure them of their mental deficiency. The leading individual, or therapist, had to be a male, preferably of an older, wiser, age, as well as free from the control of the passions. These passions, according to Galen, caused the psychological problems that people experienced.\n\nGalen may have produced more work than any author in antiquity, rivaling the quantity of work issued from Augustine of Hippo. So profuse was Galen's output that the surviving texts represent nearly half of all the extant literature from ancient Greece. It has been reported that Galen employed twenty scribes to write down his words. Galen may have written as many as 500 treatises, amounting to some 10 million words. Although his surviving works amount to some 3 million words, this is thought to represent less than a third of his complete writings. In AD 191, a fire in the Temple of Peace destroyed many of his works, in particular treatises on philosophy.\n\nBecause Galen's works were not translated into Latin in the ancient period, and because of the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, the study of Galen, along with the Greek medical tradition as a whole, went into decline in Western Europe during the Early Middle Ages, when very few Latin scholars could read Greek. However, in general, Galen and the ancient Greek medical tradition continued to be studied and followed in the Eastern Roman Empire, commonly known as the Byzantine Empire. All of the extant Greek manuscripts of Galen were copied by Byzantine scholars. In the Abbasid period (after AD 750) Arab Muslims began to be interested in Greek scientific and medical texts for the first time, and had some of Galen's texts translated into Arabic, often by Syrian Christian scholars (see below). As a result, some texts of Galen exist only in Arabic translation, while others exist only in medieval Latin translations of the Arabic. In some cases scholars have even attempted to translate from the Latin or Arabic back into Greek where the original is lost. For some of the ancient sources, such as Herophilus, Galen's account of their work is all that survives.\n\nEven in his own time, forgeries and unscrupulous editions of his work were a problem, prompting him to write \"On his Own Books\". Forgeries in Latin, Arabic or Greek continued until the Renaissance. Some of Galen's treatises have appeared under many different titles over the years. Sources are often in obscure and difficult-to-access journals or repositories. Although written in Greek, by convention the works are referred to by Latin titles, and often by merely abbreviations of those. No single authoritative collection of his work exists, and controversy remains as to the authenticity of a number of works attributed to Galen. As a consequence, research on Galen's work is fraught with hazard.\n\nVarious attempts have been made to classify Galen's vast output. For instance Coxe (1846) lists a Prolegomena, or introductory books, followed by 7 classes of treatise embracing Physiology (28 vols.), Hygiene (12), Aetiology (19), Semeiotics (14), Pharmacy (10), Blood letting (4) and Therapeutics (17), in addition to 4 of aphorisms, and spurious works. The most complete compendium of Galen's writings, surpassing even modern projects like the \"Corpus Medicorum Graecorum\", is the one compiled and translated by Karl Gottlob KÃ¼hn of Leipzig between 1821 and 1833. This collection consists of 122 of Galen's treatises, translated from the original Greek into Latin (the text is presented in both languages). Over 20,000 pages in length, it is divided into 22 volumes, with 676 index pages. Many of Galen's works are included in the \"Thesaurus Linguae Graecae\", a digital library of Greek literature started in 1972. Another useful modern source is the French BibliothÃ¨que interuniversitaire de mÃ©decine (BIUM).\n\nIn his time, Galen's reputation as both physician and philosopher was legendary, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius describing him as \"Primum sane medicorum esse, philosophorum autem solum\" (first among doctors and unique among philosophers \"Praen 14: 660\"). Other contemporary authors in the Greek world confirm this including Theodotus the Shoemaker, Athenaeus and Alexander of Aphrodisias. The 7th-century poet George of Pisida went so far as to refer to Christ as a second and neglected Galen. Galen continued to exert an important influence over the theory and practice of medicine until the mid-17th century in the Byzantine and Arabic worlds and Europe. Hippocrates and Galen form important landmarks of 600 years of Greek medicine. A. J. Brock describes them as representing the foundation and apex respectively. A few centuries after Galen, Palladius Iatrosophista stated, in his commentary on Hippocrates, that Hippocrates sowed and Galen reaped.\n\nThus Galen summarised and synthesised the work of his predecessors, and it is in Galen's words (Galenism) that Greek medicine was handed down to subsequent generations, such that Galenism became the means by which Greek medicine was known to the world. Often, this was in the form of restating and reinterpreting, such as in Magnus of Nisibis' 4th-century work on urine, which was in turn translated into Arabic. Yet the full importance of his contributions was not appreciated till long after his death. Galen's rhetoric and prolificity were so powerful as to convey the impression that there was little left to learn. The term Galenism has subsequently taken on both a positive and pejorative meaning as one that transformed medicine in late antiquity yet so dominated subsequent thinking as to stifle further progress.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Western Empire the study of Galen and other Greek works almost disappeared in the Latin West. In contrast, in the predominantly Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman empire (Byzantium), many commentators of the subsequent centuries, such as Oribasius, physician to the emperor Julian who compiled a \"Synopsis\" in the 4th century, preserved and disseminated Galen's works, making Galenism more accessible. Nutton refers to these authors as the \"medical refrigerators of antiquity\". In late antiquity, medical writing veered increasingly in the direction of the theoretical at the expense of the practical, with many authors merely debating Galenism. Magnus of Nisibis was a pure theorist, as were John of Alexandria and Agnellus of Ravenna with their lectures on Galen's \"De Sectis\". So strong was Galenism that other authors such as Hippocrates began to be seen through a Galenic lens, while his opponents became marginalised and other medical sects such as Asclepiadism slowly disappeared. Greek medicine was part of Greek culture, and Syrian Eastern Christians came in contact with it while the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) ruled Syria and Western Mesopotamia, regions that were conquered from Byzantium in the 7th century by Arab Muslims. After AD 750, Muslims had these Syrian Christians make the first translations of Galen into Arabic. From then on, Galen and the Greek medical tradition in general became assimilated into the medieval and early modern Islamic Middle East.\n\nGalen's approach to medicine became and remains influential in the Islamic world. The first major translator of Galen into Arabic was the Syrian Christian Hunayn ibn Ishaq. He translated (c. 830â870) 129 works of \"Jalinos\" into Arabic. Arabic sources, such as Rhazes (Muhammad ibn ZakarÄ«ya RÄzi AD 865â925), continue to be the source of discovery of new or relatively inaccessible Galenic writings. One of Hunayn's Arabic translations, âKitab ila Aglooqan fi Shifa al Amradâ, which is extant in the Library of Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine & Sciences, is regarded as a masterpiece of Galen's literary works. A part of the Alexandrian compendium of Galenâs work, this 10th-century manuscript comprises two parts that include details regarding various types of fevers (Humyat) and different inflammatory conditions of the body. More important is that it includes details of more than 150 single and compound formulations of both herbal and animal origin. The book provides an insight into understanding the traditions and methods of treatment in the Greek and Roman eras. In addition, this book provides a direct source for the study of more than 150 single and compound drugs used during the Greco-Roman period.\n\nAs the title, \"Doubts on Galen\" by Rhazes implies, as well as the writings of physicians such as Ibn Zuhr (Avenzoar) and Ibn al-Nafis, the works of Galen were not accepted unquestioningly, but as a challengeable basis for further inquiry. A strong emphasis on experimentation and empiricism led to new results and new observations, which were contrasted and combined with those of Galen by writers such as Rhazes, Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi (Haly Abbas), Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulasis), Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Zuhr and Ibn al-Nafis. For example, the experiments carried out by RÄzi and Ibn Zuhr contradicted the Galenic theory of humorism, while Ibn al-Nafis' discovery of the pulmonary circulation contradicted the Galenic theory on the heart.\n\nThe influence of Galen's writings, including humorism, remains strong in modern Unani medicine, now closely identified with Islamic culture, and widely practiced from India (where it is officially recognized) to Morocco.\n\nFrom the 11th century onwards, Latin translations of Islamic medical texts began to appear in the West, alongside the Salerno school of thought, and were soon incorporated into the curriculum at the universities of Naples and Montpellier. From that time, Galenism took on a new, unquestioned authority, Galen even being referred to as the \"Medical Pope of the Middle Ages\". Constantine the African was amongst those who translated both Hippocrates and Galen from Arabic. In addition to the more numerous translations of Arabic texts in this period, there were a few translations of Galenic works directly from the Greek, such as Burgundio of Pisa's translation of \"De complexionibus\". Galen's works on anatomy and medicine became the mainstay of the medieval physician's university curriculum, alongside Ibn Sina's \"The Canon of Medicine\", which elaborated on Galen's works. Unlike pagan Rome, Christian Europe did not exercise a universal prohibition of the dissection and autopsy of the human body and such examinations were carried out regularly from at least the 13th century. However, Galen's influence was so great that when dissections discovered anomalies compared with Galen's anatomy, the physicians often tried to fit these into the Galenic system. An example of this is Mondino de Liuzzi, who describes rudimentary blood circulation in his writings but still asserts that the left ventricle should contain air. Some cited these changes as proof that human anatomy had changed since the time of Galen.\n\nThe most important translator of Galen's works into Latin was NiccolÃ² di Deoprepio da Reggio, who spent several years working on Galen. NiccolÃ² worked at the Angevin Court during the reign of king Robert of Naples. Among NiccolÃ²'s translations is a piece from a medical treatise by Galen, of which the original text is lost.\n\nThe Renaissance and fall of the Byzantine Empire (1453) was accompanied by an influx of Greek scholars and manuscripts to the West, allowing direct comparison between the Arabic commentaries and the original Greek texts of Galen. This New Learning and the Humanist movement, particularly the work of Linacre, promoted \"literae humaniores\" including Galen in the Latin scientific canon, \"De Naturalibus Facultatibus\" appearing in London in 1523. Debates on medical science now had two traditions, the more conservative Arabian and the liberal Greek. The more extreme liberal movements began to challenge the role of authority in medicine, as exemplified by Paracelsus' symbolically burning the works of Avicenna and Galen at his medical school in Basle. Nevertheless, Galen's pre-eminence amongst the great thinkers of the millennium is exemplified by a 16th-century mural in the refectory of the Great Lavra of Mt Athos. It depicts pagan sages at the foot of the Tree of Jesse, with Galen between the Sibyl and Aristotle.\n\nGalenism's final defeat came from a combination of the negativism of Paracelsus and the constructivism of the Italian Renaissance anatomists, such as Vesalius in the 16th century. In the 1530s, the Flemish anatomist and physician Andreas Vesalius took on a project to translate many of Galen's Greek texts into Latin. Vesalius' most famous work, \"De humani corporis fabrica\", was greatly influenced by Galenic writing and form. Seeking to examine critically Galen's methods and outlook, Vesalius turned to human cadaver dissection as a means of verification. Galen's writings were shown by Vesalius to describe details present in monkeys but not in humans, and he demonstrated Galen's limitations through books and hands-on demonstrations despite fierce opposition from orthodox pro-Galenists such as Jacobus Sylvius. Since Galen states that he is using observations of monkeys (human dissection was prohibited) to give an account of what the body looks like, Vesalius could portray himself as using Galen's approach of description of direct observation to create a record of the exact details of the human body, since he worked in a time when human dissection was allowed. Galen argued that monkey anatomy was close enough to humans for physicians to learn anatomy with monkey dissections and then make observations of similar structures in the wounds of their patients, rather than trying to learn anatomy only from wounds in human patients, as would be done by students trained by the Empiricist medical sect would. The examinations of Vesalius also disproved medical theories of Aristotle and Mondino de Liuzzi. One of the best known examples of Vesalius' overturning of Galenism was his demonstration that the interventricular septum of the heart was not permeable, as Galen had taught (\"Nat Fac III xv\"). However, this had been revealed two years before by Michael Servetus in his fateful \"\"Christianismi restitutio\"\" (1553) with only three copies of the book surviving, but these remaining hidden for decades; the rest were burned shortly after its publication because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.\n\nMichael Servetus, using the name \"Michel de Villeneuve\" during his stay in France, was Vesalius' fellow student and the best Galenist at the University of Paris, according to Johann Winter von Andernach, who taught both. In the Galenism of the Renaissance, editions of the \"Opera Omnia\" by Galen were very important. It was begun in Venice in 1541â1542 by the Guinta. There were fourteen editions of the book from that date until 1625. Just one edition was produced from Lyon between 1548 and 1551. The Lyon edition has commentaries on breathing and blood streaming that correct the work of earlier renowned authors such as Vesalius, Caius or Janus Cornarius. \"Michel De Villeneuve\" had contracts with Jean Frellon for that work, and the Servetus scholar-researcher Francisco Javier GonzÃ¡lez EcheverrÃ­a presented research that became an accepted communication in the International Society for the History of Medicine, which concluded that Michael De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus) is the author of the commentaries of this edition of Frellon, in Lyon.\n\nAnother convincing case where understanding of the body was extended beyond where Galen had left it came from these demonstrations of the nature of human circulation and the subsequent work of Andrea Cesalpino, Fabricio of Acquapendente and William Harvey. Some Galenic teaching, such as his emphasis on bloodletting as a remedy for many ailments, however, remained influential until well into the 19th century.\n\nGalenic scholarship remains an intense and vibrant field, following renewed interest in his work, dating from the German encyclopedia \"RealencyclopÃ¤die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft\".\n\nCopies of his works translated by Robert M. Green are held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12326", "title": "Galen"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12327", "text": "Glossolalia\n\nGlossolalia or speaking in tongues, according to linguists, is the fluid vocalizing of speech-like syllables that lack any readily comprehended meaning, in some cases as part of religious practice in which it is believed to be a divine language unknown to the speaker. Glossolalia is practiced in Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity as well as in other religions. The term derives from glÅssais lalÅ, a Greek phrase used in the New Testament meaning \"speak in, with, or by tongues [i.e., other languages]\" (, ).\n\nThe related phenomenon âxenolaliaâ or \"xenoglossy\" is when the language being spoken is a natural language previously unknown to the speaker.\n\n\"Glossolalia\" is constructed from the Greek word Î³Î»ÏÏÏÎ¿Î»Î±Î»Î¯Î±, itself a compound of the words Î³Î»á¿¶ÏÏÎ± (\"glossa\"), meaning \"tongue\" or \"language\" and Î»Î±Î»Î­Ï (\"laleÅ\"), \"to speak, talk, chat, prattle, or to make a sound\". The Greek expression (in various forms) appears in the New Testament in the books of Acts and First Corinthians.\n\nThe exact phrase \"speaking in tongues\" has been used at least since the translation of the New Testament into Middle English in the Wycliffe Bible in the 14th century. Frederic Farrar first used the word \"glossolalia\" in 1879.\n\nIn 1972, William J. Samarin, a linguist from the University of Toronto, published a thorough assessment of Pentecostal glossolalia that became a classic work on its linguistic characteristics. His assessment was based on a large sample of glossolalia recorded in public and private Christian meetings in Italy, The Netherlands, Jamaica, Canada and the US over the course of five years; his wide range included the Puerto Ricans of the Bronx, the Snake Handlers of the Appalachians and the Spiritual Christians from Russia in Los Angeles (\"Pryguny, Dukhizhizniki\").\n\nSamarin found that glossolalic speech does resemble human language in some respects. The speaker uses accent, rhythm, intonation and pauses to break up the speech into distinct units. Each unit is itself made up of syllables, the syllables being formed from consonants and vowels taken from a language known to the speaker:\n\nIt is verbal behaviour that consists of using a certain number of consonants and vowels[...]in a limited number of syllables that in turn are organized into larger units that are taken apart and rearranged pseudogrammatically[...]with variations in pitch, volume, speed and intensity.\n[Glossolalia] consists of strings of syllables, made up of sounds taken from all those that the speaker knows, put together more or less haphazardly but emerging nevertheless as word-like and sentence-like units because of realistic, language-like rhythm and melody.\nThat the sounds are taken from the set of sounds already known to the speaker is confirmed by others. Felicitas Goodman, a psychological anthropologist and linguist, also found that the speech of glossolalists reflected the patterns of speech of the speaker's native language.\n\nSamarin found that the resemblance to human language was merely on the surface and so concluded that glossolalia is \"only a facade of language\". He reached this conclusion because the syllable string did not form words, the stream of speech was not internally organized, and â most importantly of all â there was no systematic relationship between units of speech and concepts. Humans use language to communicate but glossolalia does not. Therefore, he concluded that glossolalia is not \"a specimen of human language because it is neither internally organized nor systematically related to the world man perceives\". On the basis of his linguistic analysis, Samarin defined Pentecostal glossolalia as \"meaningless but phonologically structured human utterance, believed by the speaker to be a real language but bearing no systematic resemblance to any natural language, living or dead\".\n\nPractitioners of glossolalia may disagree with linguistic researchers and claim that they are speaking human languages (xenoglossia). Felicitas Goodman studied a number of Pentecostal communities in the United States, the Caribbean and Mexico; these included English-, Spanish- and Mayan-speaking groups. She compared what she found with recordings of non-Christian rituals from Africa, Borneo, Indonesia and Japan. She took into account both the segmental structure (such as sounds, syllables, phrases) and the supra-segmental elements (rhythm, accent, intonation) and concluded that there was no distinction between what was practised by the Pentecostal Protestants and the followers of other religions.\n\nIt was a commonplace idea within the Greco-Roman world that divine beings spoke languages different from human languages, and historians of religion have identified references to esoteric speech in Greco-Roman literature that resemble glossolalia, sometimes explained as angelic or divine language. An example is the account in the Testament of Job where the daughters of Job were given sashes enabling them to speak and sing in angelic languages.\n\nAccording to Dale B. Martin, glossolalia accorded high status in the ancient world due to its association with the divine. Alexander of Abonoteichus may have exhibited glossolalia during his episodes of prophetic ecstasy. Neoplatonist philosopher Iamblichus linked glossolalia to prophecy, writing that prophecy was divine spirit possession that \"emits words which are not understood by those that utter them; for they pronounce them, as it is said, with an insane mouth (\"mainomenÏ stomati\") and are wholly subservient, and entirely yield themselves to the energy of the predominating God.\"\n\nAs part of his attack on early Christianity, the Greek philosopher Celsus may include an account of Christian glossolalia. Celsus describes prophecies made by several Christians in Palestine and Phoenicia of which he writes, \"Having brandished these threats they then go on to add incomprehensible, incoherent, and utterly obscure utterances, the meaning of which no intelligent person could discover: for they are meaningless and nonsensical, and give a chance for any fool or sorcerer to take the words in whatever sense he likes.\"\n\nReferences to speaking in tongues by the Church fathers are rare. Except for Irenaeus' 2nd-century reference to many in the church speaking all kinds of languages \"through the Spirit\", and Tertullian's reference in 207 AD to the spiritual gift of interpretation of tongues being encountered in his day, there are no other known first-hand accounts of glossolalia, and very few second-hand accounts among their writings.\n\n\nDuring the 20th century, glossolalia would primarily become associated with Pentecostalism and the later charismatic movement. The holiness preachers Charles Parham and William Seymour are credited as co-founders of the movement. It was Parham who formulated the doctrine of \"initial evidence\". After studying the Bible, Parham came to the conclusion that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence that one had received the baptism with the Holy Spirit.\n\nIn 1900, Parham opened Bethel Bible College in Topeka, Kansas, where he taught initial evidence. During a service on 1 January 1901, a student named Agnes Ozman asked for prayer and the laying on of hands to specifically ask God to fill her with the Holy Spirit. She became the first of many students to experience glossolalia, coincidentally in the first hours of the 20th century. Parham followed within the next few days. Parham called his new movement the Apostolic Faith. In 1905, he moved to Houston and opened a Bible school there. One of his students was William Seymour, an African-American preacher. In 1906, Seymour traveled to Los Angeles where his preaching ignited the Azusa Street Revival. This revival is considered the birth of the global Pentecostal movement. Witnesses at the Azusa Street Revival wrote of seeing fire resting on the heads of participants, miraculous healings in the meetings, and incidents of speaking in tongues being understood by native speakers of the language. According to the first issue of William Seymour's newsletter, \"The Apostolic Faith\", from 1906:\nParham and his early followers believed that speaking in tongues was xenoglossia, and some followers traveled to foreign countries and tried to use the gift to share the Gospel with non-English-speaking people. These attempts consistently resulted in failure and many of Parham's followers rejected his teachings after being disillusioned with their attempts to speak unlearned foreign languages. Despite these setbacks, belief in xenoglossia persisted into the latter half of the 20th century among Pentecostal groups.\n\nThe revival at Azusa Street lasted until around 1915. From it grew many new Pentecostal churches as people visited the services in Los Angeles and took their newfound beliefs to communities around the United States and abroad. During the 20th century, glossolalia became an important part of the identity of these religious groups. During the 1960s, the charismatic movement within the mainline Protestant churches and among charismatic Roman Catholics would adopt some Pentecostal beliefs, and the practice of glossolalia would spread to other Christian denominations. The discussion regarding tongues has permeated many branches of the Protestantism, particularly since the widespread Charismatic Movement in the 1960s. Many books have been published either defending or attacking the practice.\n\nIn Christianity, a supernatural explanation for glossolalia is advocated by some and rejected by others.\n\nProponents of each viewpoint use the biblical writings and historical arguments to support their positions.\n\nThere are five places in the New Testament where speaking in tongues is referred to \"explicitly\":\n\nOther verses by inference may be considered to refer to \"speaking in tongues\", such as , and .\n\nThe biblical account of Pentecost in the second chapter of the book of Acts describes the sound of a mighty rushing wind and \"divided tongues like fire\" coming to rest on the apostles. The text further describes that \"they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages\". It goes on to say in verses 5-11 that when the Apostles spoke, each person in attendance \"heard their own language being spoken\". Therefore, the gift of speaking in tongues refers to the Apostles' speaking languages that the people listening heard as \"them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God\". Glossolalists and cessationists both recognize this as xenoglossia, a miraculous ability that marked their baptism in the Holy Spirit. Something similar (although perhaps not xenoglossia) took place on at least two subsequent occasions, in Caesarea and Ephesus.\n\nGlossolalists and cessationists generally agree that the primary purpose of the gift of speaking in tongues was to mark the Holy Spirit being poured out. At Pentecost the Apostle Peter declared that this gift, which was making some in the audience ridicule the disciples as drunks, was the fulfilment of the prophecy of Joel which described that God would pour out his Spirit on all flesh ().\n\nDespite these commonalities, there are significant variations in interpretation.\n\nBecause Pentecostal and charismatic beliefs are not monolithic, there is not complete theological agreement on speaking in tongues. Generally, however, it is agreed that speaking in tongues is a spiritual gift that can be manifested as either a human language or a heavenly supernatural language in three ways. The \"sign of tongues\" refers to xenoglossia, wherein one speaks an actual language he has never learned. The \"gift of tongues\" refers to a glossolalic utterance spoken by an individual and addressed to a congregation of, typically, other believers. Lastly, \"praying in the spirit\" is typically used to refer to glossolalia as part of personal prayer. Many Pentecostals and charismatics adhere to Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 14 which established guidelines on the public use of glossolalia in the church at Corinth.\n\nThe gift of tongues is often referred to as a \"message in tongues\". This use of glossolalia requires an interpretation so that the gathered congregation can understand the message. This is accomplished by the interpretation of tongues, another spiritual gift. There are two schools of thoughts concerning the nature of a message in tongues. One school of thought believes it is always directed \"to\" God as prayer, praise, or thanksgiving but is spoken in for the hearing and edification of the congregation. The other school of thought believes that a message in tongues can be a prophetic utterance inspired by the Holy Spirit. In this case, the speaker delivers a message to the congregation on behalf of God.\n\nIn addition to praying in the Spirit, many Pentecostal and charismatic churches practice what is known as singing in the Spirit.\n\nOther religious groups have been observed to practice some form of theopneustic glossolalia. It is perhaps most commonly in Paganism, Shamanism, and other mediumistic religious practices. In Japan, the God Light Association believed that glossolalia could cause adherents to recall past lives.\n\nGlossolalia has even been postulated as an explanation for the Voynich manuscript.\n\nIn the 19th century, Spiritism was developed by the work of Allan Kardec, and the phenomenon was seen as one of the self-evident manifestations of spirits. Spiritists argued that some cases were actually cases of xenoglossia.\n\nGlossolalia has also been observed in the Voodoo religion of Haiti, as well as in the Hindu Gurus and Muslim Fakirs of India.\n\nSome Jewish groups sing or chant nigunim, which are often melodies not consisting of recognizable words, but of repetitive or other syllables. Sometimes, they are repetitive singing of recognizable words.\n\n\nReligious perspectives\n\nOther\n\n", "id": "12327", "title": "Glossolalia"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12332", "text": "Gustav Kirchhoff\n\nGustav Robert Kirchhoff (12 March 1824Â â 17 October 1887) was a German physicist who contributed to the fundamental understanding of electrical circuits, spectroscopy, and the emission of black-body radiation by heated objects.\n\nHe coined the term \"black body\" radiation in 1862, and two different sets of concepts (one in circuit theory, and one in spectroscopy) are named \"Kirchhoff's laws\" after him; there is also a Kirchhoff's Law in thermochemistry. The BunsenâKirchhoff Award for spectroscopy is named after him and his colleague, Robert Bunsen.\n\nGustav Kirchhoff was born in KÃ¶nigsberg, Prussia, the son of Friedrich Kirchhoff, a lawyer, and Johanna Henriette Wittke. He graduated from the Albertus University of KÃ¶nigsberg in 1847 where he attended the mathematico-physical seminar directed by Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, Franz Ernst Neumann and Friedrich Julius Richelot. In the same year, he moved to Berlin, where he stayed until he received a professorship at Breslau. Later, in 1857, He married Clara Richelot, the daughter of his mathematics professor Richelot. The couple had five children. Clara died in 1869. He married Luise BrÃ¶mmel in 1872.\nKirchhoff formulated his circuit laws, which are now ubiquitous in electrical engineering, in 1845, while still a student. He completed this study as a seminar exercise; it later became his doctoral dissertation. In 1857 he calculated that an electric signal in a resistanceless wire travels along the wire at the speed of light. He proposed his law of thermal radiation in 1859, and gave a proof in 1861. He was called to the University of Heidelberg in 1854, where he collaborated in spectroscopic work with Robert Bunsen. Together Kirchhoff and Bunsen discovered caesium and rubidium in 1861. At Heidelberg he ran a mathematico-physical seminar, modelled on Neumann's, with the mathematician Leo Koenigsberger. Among those who attended this seminar were Arthur Schuster and Sofia Kovalevskaya. In 1875 Kirchhoff accepted the first chair specifically dedicated to theoretical physics at Berlin.\n\nIn 1862 he was awarded the Rumford Medal for his researches on the fixed lines of the solar spectrum, and on the inversion of the bright lines in the spectra of artificial light.\n\nHe contributed greatly to the field of spectroscopy by formalizing three laws that describe the spectral composition of light emitted by incandescent objects, building substantially on the discoveries of David Alter and Anders Jonas ÃngstrÃ¶m (see also: spectrum analysis).\n\nHe also contributed to optics, carefully solving Maxwell's equations to provide a solid foundation for Huygens' principle (and correct it in the process).\n\nIn 1884 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nKirchhoff died in 1887, and was buried in the St MatthÃ¤us Kirchhof Cemetery in SchÃ¶neberg, Berlin (just a few meters from the graves of the Brothers Grimm).\n\nLeopold Kronecker is buried in the same cemetery.\n\nKirchhoff's first law is that the algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point (or node) is zero. The second law is that in a closed circuit, the directed sums of the voltages in a closed system is zero.\n\n\nKirchhoff did not know about the existence of energy levels in atoms. The existence of discrete spectral lines was later explained by the Bohr model of the atom, which helped lead to quantum mechanics.\n\nKirchhoff showed in 1858 that the variation of the heat of a chemical reaction is given by the difference in heat capacity between products and reactants: dÎH / dT = ÎC. Integration of this equation permits the evaluation of the heat of reaction at one temperature from measurements at another temperature.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12332", "title": "Gustav Kirchhoff"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12333", "text": "G. K. Chesterton\n\nGilbert Keith Chesterton, KC*SG (29 May 1874Â â 14 June 1936), better known as G. K. Chesterton, was an English writer, poet, philosopher, dramatist, journalist, orator, lay theologian, biographer, and literary and art critic. Chesterton is often referred to as the \"prince of paradox\". \"Time\" magazine has observed of his writing style: \"Whenever possible Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegoriesâfirst carefully turning them inside out.\"\n\nChesterton is well known for his fictional priest-detective Father Brown, and for his reasoned apologetics. Even some of those who disagree with him have recognised the wide appeal of such works as \"Orthodoxy\" and \"The Everlasting Man\". Chesterton, as a political thinker, cast aspersions on both Progressivism and Conservatism, saying, \"The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected.\" Chesterton routinely referred to himself as an \"orthodox\" Christian, and came to identify this position more and more with Catholicism, eventually converting to Catholicism from High Church Anglicanism. George Bernard Shaw, Chesterton's \"friendly enemy\" according to \"Time\", said of him, \"He was a man of colossal genius.\" Biographers have identified him as a successor to such Victorian authors as Matthew Arnold, Thomas Carlyle, Cardinal John Henry Newman, and John Ruskin.\n\nChesterton was born in Campden Hill in Kensington, London, the son of Marie Louise, nÃ©e Grosjean, and Edward Chesterton. He was baptised at the age of one month into the Church of England, though his family themselves were irregularly practising Unitarians. According to his autobiography, as a young man Chesterton became fascinated with the occult and, along with his brother Cecil, experimented with Ouija boards.\n\nChesterton was educated at St Paul's School, then attended the Slade School of Art to become an illustrator. The Slade is a department of University College London, where Chesterton also took classes in literature, but did not complete a degree in either subject.\n\nChesterton married Frances Blogg in 1901; the marriage lasted the rest of his life. Chesterton credited Frances with leading him back to Anglicanism, though he later considered Anglicanism to be a \"pale imitation\". He entered full communion with the Catholic Church in 1922.\n\nIn 1896 Chesterton began working for the London publisher Redway, and T. Fisher Unwin, where he remained until 1902. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902 the \"Daily News\" gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in \"The Illustrated London News\", for which he continued to write for the next thirty years.\n\nEarly on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images. Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. Father Brown is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story \"The Flying Stars\", Father Brown entreats the character Flambeau to give up his life of crime: \"There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don't fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it. Many a man I've known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime.\"\nChesterton loved to debate, often engaging in friendly public disputes with such men as George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Bertrand Russell and Clarence Darrow. According to his autobiography, he and Shaw played cowboys in a silent film that was never released.\n\nChesterton was a large man, standing and weighing around . His girth gave rise to a famous anecdote. During the First World War a lady in London asked why he was not \"out at the Front\"; he replied, \"If you go round to the side, you will see that I am.\" On another occasion he remarked to his friend George Bernard Shaw, \"To look at you, anyone would think a famine had struck England.\" Shaw retorted, \"To look at you, anyone would think you have caused it.\" P. G. Wodehouse once described a very loud crash as \"a sound like G. K. Chesterton falling onto a sheet of tin\".\n\nChesterton usually wore a cape and a crumpled hat, with a swordstick in hand, and a cigar hanging out of his mouth. He had a tendency to forget where he was supposed to be going and miss the train that was supposed to take him there. It is reported that on several occasions he sent a telegram to his wife Frances from some distant (and incorrect) location, writing such things as \"Am in Market Harborough. Where ought I to be?\" to which she would reply, \"Home\". (Chesterton himself tells the story, omitting, however, his wife's alleged reply, in ch. XVI of his autobiography.) Because of these instances of absent-mindedness and of Chesterton being extremely clumsy as a child, there has been speculation that Chesterton had undiagnosed developmental coordination disorder or attention deficit disorder.\n\nIn 1931, the BBC invited Chesterton to give a series of radio talks. He accepted, tentatively at first. However, from 1932 until his death, Chesterton delivered over 40 talks per year. He was allowed (and encouraged) to improvise on the scripts. This allowed his talks to maintain an intimate character, as did the decision to allow his wife and secretary to sit with him during his broadcasts.\n\nThe talks were very popular. A BBC official remarked, after Chesterton's death, that \"in another year or so, he would have become the dominating voice from Broadcasting House.\"\n\nChesterton died of congestive heart failure on the morning of 14 June 1936, at his home in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. His last known words were a greeting spoken to his wife. The homily at Chesterton's Requiem Mass in Westminster Cathedral, London, was delivered by Ronald Knox on 27 June 1936. Knox said, \"All of this generation has grown up under Chesterton's influence so completely that we do not even know when we are thinking Chesterton.\" He is buried in Beaconsfield in the Catholic Cemetery. Chesterton's estate was probated at Â£28,389, approximately equivalent in 2012 terms to Â£1.3Â million.\n\nNear the end of Chesterton's life, Pope Pius XI invested him as Knight Commander with Star of the Papal Order of St. Gregory the Great (KC*SG). The Chesterton Society has proposed that he be beatified. He is remembered liturgically on 13 June by the Episcopal Church, with a provisional feast day as adopted at the 2009 General Convention.\n\nChesterton wrote around 80 books, several hundred poems, some 200 short stories, 4000 essays, and several plays. He was a literary and social critic, historian, playwright, novelist, Catholic theologian and apologist, debater, and mystery writer. He was a columnist for the \"Daily News\", \"The Illustrated London News\", and his own paper, \"G. K.'s Weekly\"; he also wrote articles for the \"EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica\", including the entry on Charles Dickens and part of the entry on Humour in the 14th edition (1929). His best-known character is the priest-detective Father Brown, who appeared only in short stories, while \"The Man Who Was Thursday\" is arguably his best-known novel. He was a convinced Christian long before he was received into the Catholic Church, and Christian themes and symbolism appear in much of his writing. In the United States, his writings on distributism were popularised through \"The American Review\", published by Seward Collins in New York.\n\nOf his nonfiction, \"Charles Dickens: A Critical Study\" (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise. According to Ian Ker (\"The Catholic Revival in English Literature, 1845â1961\", 2003), \"In Chesterton's eyes Dickens belongs to Merry, not Puritan, England\"; Ker treats Chesterton's thought in Chapter 4 of that book as largely growing out of his true appreciation of Dickens, a somewhat shop-soiled property in the view of other literary opinions of the time.\n\nChesterton's writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humour. He employed paradox, while making serious comments on the world, government, politics, economics, philosophy, theology and many other topics.\n\nChesterton's writing has been seen by some analysts as combining two earlier strands in English literature. Dickens' approach is one of these. Another is represented by Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw, whom Chesterton knew well: satirists and social commentators following in the tradition of Samuel Butler, vigorously wielding paradox as a weapon against complacent acceptance of the conventional view of things.\n\nChesterton's style and thinking were all his own, however, and his conclusions were often opposed to those of Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. In his book \"Heretics\", Chesterton has this to say of Wilde: \"The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde. It is the carpe diem religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw.\" More briefly, and with a closer approximation of Wilde's own style, he writes in \"Orthodoxy\" concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: \"Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde.\"\n\nChesterton and Shaw were famous friends and enjoyed their arguments and discussions. Although rarely in agreement, they both maintained good will toward and respect for each other. However, in his writing, Chesterton expressed himself very plainly on where they differed and why. In \"Heretics\" he writes of Shaw:\n\nShaw represented the new school of thought, modernism, which was rising at the time. Chesterton's views, on the other hand, became increasingly more focused towards the Church. In \"Orthodoxy\" he writes: \"The worship of will is the negation of will â¦ If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up to me and says, 'Will something', that is tantamount to saying, 'I do not mind what you will', and that is tantamount to saying, 'I have no will in the matter.' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular.\"\nThis style of argumentation is what Chesterton refers to as using 'Uncommon Sense' â that is, that the thinkers and popular philosophers of the day, though very clever, were saying things that were nonsensical. This is illustrated again in \"Orthodoxy\": \"Thus when Mr. H. G. Wells says (as he did somewhere), 'All chairs are quite different', he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them 'all chairs'.\" Or, again from \"Orthodoxy\":\n\nThe wild worship of lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy in the land of nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless â one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is â well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.\n\nAnother contemporary and friend from schooldays was Edmund Bentley, inventor of the clerihew. Chesterton himself wrote clerihews and illustrated his friend's first published collection of poetry, \"Biography for Beginners\" (1905), which popularised the clerihew form. Chesterton was also godfather to Bentley's son, Nicolas, and opened his novel \"The Man Who Was Thursday\" with a poem written to Bentley.\n\nChesterton faced accusations of anti-Semitism during his lifetime, as well as posthumously. An early supporter of Captain Dreyfus, by 1906 he had turned into an anti-dreyfusard. From the early 20th century, both his fictional and non-fictional work included caricatures of Jews, stereotyping them as greedy, cowardly, disloyal and communists.\n\nThe Marconi scandal of 1912â13 brought issues of anti-Semitism into the political mainstream, on the basis that senior ministers in the Liberal government had secretly profited from advanced knowledge of deals regarding wireless telegraphy. Some of the key players were Jewish. Historian Todd Edelman identifies Catholic writers as central critics:\n\nThe most virulent attacks in the Marconi affair were launched by Hilaire Belloc and the brothers Cecil and G. K. Chesterton, whose hostility to Jews was linked to their opposition to liberalism, their backward-looking Catholicism, and the nostalgia for a medieval Catholic Europe that they imagined was ordered, harmonious, and homogeneous. The Jew baiting at the time of The Boer War and the Marconi scandal was linked to a broader protest, mounted in the main by the Radical wing of the Liberal Party, against the growing visibility of successful businessmen in national life and the challenges. What were seen as traditional English values.\n\nHistorian Frances Donaldson says, \"If Belloc's feeling against the Jews was instinctive and under some control, Chesterton's was open and vicious, and he shared with Belloc the peculiarity that the Jews were never far from his thoughts.\"\n\nIn a work of 1917, titled \"A Short History of England\", Chesterton considers the royal decree of 1290 by which Edward I expelled Jews from England, a policy that remained in place until 1655. Chesterton writes that popular perception of Jewish moneylenders could well have led Edward I's subjects to regard him as a \"tender father of his people\" for \"breaking the rule by which the rulers had hitherto fostered their bankers' wealth\". He felt that Jews, \"a sensitive and highly civilized people\" who \"were the capitalists of the age, the men with wealth banked ready for use\", might legitimately complain that \"Christian kings and nobles, and even Christian popes and bishops, used for Christian purposes (such as the Crusades and the cathedrals) the money that could only be accumulated in such mountains by a usury they inconsistently denounced as unchristian; and then, when worse times came, gave up the Jew to the fury of the poor\".\n\nIn \"The New Jerusalem\", Chesterton made it clear that he believed that there was a \"Jewish Problem\" in Europe, in the sense that he believed that Jewish culture (though not Jewish ethnicity) separated itself from the nationalities of Europe. He argued that he was quite in favour of a Jew becoming Prime Minister or Lord Chancellor, under the condition, though, that \"every Jew must be dressed like an Arab [â¦] The point applies to any Jew, and to our own recovery of healthier relations with him. The point is that we should know where we are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land.\" He suggested the formation of a Jewish homeland as a solution, and was later invited to Palestine by Jewish Zionists who saw him as an ally in their cause. Later he grew out of the notion of Palestine as a Jewish homeland, and suggested somewhere in Africa instead.\n\nChesterton, like Belloc, openly expressed his abhorrence of Hitler's rule almost as soon as it started.\n\nIn \"The Truth about the Tribes\" Chesterton blasted German race theories writing \"the essence of Nazi Nationalism is to preserve the purity of a race in a continent where all races are impure.\"\n\nThe historian Simon Mayers points out that Chesterton wrote in works such as \"The Crank\", \"The Heresy of Race\", and \"The Barbarian as Bore\" against the concept of racial superiority and critiqued pseudo-scientific race theories saying they were akin to a new religion. In \"The Truth About the Tribes\" Chesterton wrote \"The curse of race religion is that it makes each separate man the sacred image which he worships. His own bones are the sacred relics; his own blood is the blood of St. Januarius.\"\n\nMayers records that despite \"his hostility towards Nazi antisemitism â¦ [it's unfortunate that he made] claims that 'Hitlerism' was a form of Judaism, and that the Jews were partly responsible for race theory.\" In \"The Judaism of Hitler\" Chesterton wrote \"Hitlerism is almost entirely of Jewish origin.\" In \"A Queer Choice\" Chesterton maintained that the only possible source of \"the Hitlerites\" idea of \"a Chosen Race\" was \"from the Jews.\" In \"The Crank\" Chesterton went on to say \"If there is one outstanding quality in Hitlerism it is its Hebraism\" and \"the new Nordic Man has all the worst faults of the worst Jews: jealousy, greed, the mania of conspiracy, and above all, the belief in a Chosen Race.\"\n\nMayers also shows that Chesterton didn't just portray Jews as culturally and religiously distinct, but racially as well. Chesterton wrote \"The Feud of the Foreigner\" in 1920 saying that the Jew \"is a foreigner far more remote from us than is a Bavarian from a Frenchman; he is divided by the same type of division as that between us and a Chinaman or a Hindoo. He not only is not, but never was, of the same race.\"\n\nIn \"The Everlasting Man\", while writing about human sacrifice, Chesterton suggested that medieval stories about Jews killing children might have resulted from a distortion of genuine cases of devil-worship. Chesterton wrote \"The Hebrew prophets were perpetually protesting against the Hebrew race relapsing into an idolatry that involved such a war upon children; and it is probable enough that this abominable apostasy from the God of Israel has occasionally appeared in Israel since, in the form of what is called ritual murder; not of course by any representative of the religion of Judaism, but by individual and irresponsible diabolists who did happen to be Jews.\" Chesterton goes on in the paragraph to speak of \"the enormous [devotional] popularity of the Child Martyr of the Middle Ages\" and of little St. Hugh (figures held to have been ritual victims of Jews).\n\nThe has devoted a whole issue of its magazine, \"Gilbert\", to defending Chesterton against charges of antisemitism.\n\nIn \"Eugenics and Other Evils\" Chesterton attacked eugenics as Britain was moving towards passage of the Mental Deficiency Act 1913. Some backing the ideas of eugenics called for the government to sterilise people deemed \"mentally defective\"; this view did not gain popularity but the idea of segregating them from the rest of society and thereby preventing them from reproducing did gain traction. These ideas disgusted Chesterton who wrote, \"It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not happen to think intelligent from having any wife or children.\" He blasted the proposed wording for such measures as being so vague as to apply to anyone, including \"Every tramp who is sulk, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs. That is the situation; and that is the point â¦ we are already under the Eugenist State; and nothing remains to us but rebellion.\"\n\nHe derided such ideas as founded on nonsense, \"as if one had a right to dragoon and enslave one's fellow citizens as a kind of chemical experiment\".\n\nChesterton also mocked the idea that poverty was a result of bad breeding: \"[it is a] strange new disposition to regard the poor as a race; as if they were a colony of Japs or Chinese coolies â¦ The poor are not a race or even a type. It is senseless to talk about breeding them; for they are not a breed. They are, in cold fact, what Dickens describes: 'a dustbin of individual accidents,' of damaged dignity, and often of damaged gentility.\"\n\nChesterton is often associated with his close friend, the poet and essayist Hilaire Belloc. George Bernard Shaw coined the name \"Chesterbelloc\" for their partnership, and this stuck. Though they were very different men, they shared many beliefs; Chesterton eventually joined Belloc in the Catholic faith, and both voiced criticisms of capitalism and socialism. They instead espoused a third way: distributism. \"G. K.'s Weekly\", which occupied much of Chesterton's energy in the last 15 years of his life, was the successor to Belloc's \"New Witness\", taken over from Cecil Chesterton, Gilbert's brother, who died in World War I.\n\n\n\nIn 1974, Father Ian Boyd, C.S.B, founded \"The Chesterton Review\", a scholarly journal devoted to Chesterton and his circle. The journal is published by the G.K. Chesterton Institute for Faith and Culture based in Seton Hall University, South Orange, New Jersey, US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12333", "title": "G. K.

The author of the tune is unknown and it may originate in plainchant, but a 1619 attribution to John Bull is sometimes made.\n\nIt is the national anthem of the United Kingdom and one of two national anthems used by New Zealand since 1977, as well as for several of the UK's territories that have their own additional local anthem. It is also the royal anthem of all the aforementioned countries, as well as Australia (since 1984), Canada (since 1980), Barbados and Tuvalu. In countries not previously part of the British Empire, the tune of \"God Save the Queen\" has provided the basis for various patriotic songs, though still generally connected with royal ceremony. In the United States, the melody is used for the patriotic song \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\". The melody is also used for the national anthem of Liechtenstein, \"Oben am jungen Rhein\".\n\nBeyond its first verse, which is consistent, \"God Save the Queen/King\" has many historic and extant versions. Since its first publication, different verses have been added and taken away and, even today, different publications include various selections of verses in various orders. In general, only one verse is sung. Sometimes two verses are sung, and on rare occasions, three.\n\nThe sovereign and her or his consort are saluted with the entire anthem, while other members of the Royal Family who are entitled to royal salute (such as the Prince of Wales) receive just the first six bars. The first six bars also form all or part of the Vice Regal Salute in some Commonwealth realms outside the UK (e.g., in Canada, governors general and lieutenant governors at official events are saluted with the first six bars of \"God Save the Queen\" followed by the first four and last four bars of \"O Canada\"), as well as the salute given to governors of British overseas territories.\n\nIn \"The Oxford Companion to Music\", Percy Scholes points out the similarities to an early plainsong melody, although the rhythm is very distinctly that of a galliard, and he gives examples of several such dance tunes that bear a striking resemblance to \"God Save the King/Queen\". Scholes quotes a keyboard piece by John Bull (1619) which has some similarities to the modern tune, depending on the placing of accidentals which at that time were unwritten in certain cases and left to the discretion of the player (see \"musica ficta\"). He also points to several pieces by Henry Purcell, one of which includes the opening notes of the modern tune, set to the words \"God Save the King\". Nineteenth-century scholars and commentators mention the widespread belief that an old Scots carol, \"Remember O Thou Man\" was the source of the tune.\n\nThe first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in 1744 in \"Thesaurus Musicus\". The 1744 version of the song was popularised in Scotland and England the following year, with the landing of Charles Edward Stuart and was published in \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" (see illustration above). This manuscript has the tune depart from that which is used today at several points, one as early as the first bar, but is otherwise clearly a strong relative of the contemporary anthem. It was recorded as being sung in London theatres in 1745, with, for example, Thomas Arne writing a setting of the tune for the Drury Lane Theatre.\n\nScholes' analysis includes mention of \"untenable\" and \"doubtful\" claims, as well as \"an American misattribution\". Some of these are:\n\nScholes recommends the attribution \"traditional\" or \"traditional; earliest known version by John Bull (1562â1628)\". The \"English Hymnal\" (musical editor Ralph Vaughan Williams) gives no attribution, stating merely \"17th or 18th cent.\"\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" is the national anthem of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Like many aspects of British constitutional life, its official status derives from custom and use, not from Royal Proclamation or Act of Parliament. In general only one or two verses are sung, but on rare occasions three. The variation in Britain of the lyrics to \"God Save the Queen\" is the oldest amongst those currently used, and forms the basis on which all other versions used throughout the Commonwealth are formed; though, again, the words have varied throughout these years.\n\nEngland has no official national anthem of its own; \"God Save the Queen\" is treated as the English national anthem when England is represented at sporting events (though there are some exceptions to this rule, such as cricket where Jerusalem is used). There is a movement to establish an English national anthem, with Blake and Parry's \"Jerusalem\" and Elgar's \"Land of Hope and Glory\" among the top contenders. Scotland has its own national song and Wales has its own national anthem for political and national events and for use at international football, rugby union and other sports in which those nations compete independently. On all occasions Wales' national anthem is \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" (Land of my Fathers). Scotland has no single anthem; \"Scotland the Brave\" was traditionally used until the 1990s, when \"Flower of Scotland\" was adopted. In Northern Ireland, \"God Save the Queen\" is still used as the official anthem.\n\nThe phrase \"No surrender\" is occasionally sung in the bridge before \"Send her victorious\" by England football fans at matches. The phrase \"no surrender\" is also associated with Combat 18, a white supremacist group. The phrase is also associated with Ulster loyalism and can sometimes be heard at the same point before Northern Ireland football matches.\n\nSince 2003, \"God Save the Queen\", considered an all inclusive Anthem for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as other countries within the Commonwealth, has been dropped from the Commonwealth Games. Northern Irish athletes receive their gold medals to the tune of the \"Londonderry Air\", popularly known as \"Danny Boy\". In 2006, English winners heard Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1, usually known as \"Land of Hope and Glory\", but after a poll conducted by the Commonwealth Games Council for England prior to the 2010 Games, \"Jerusalem\" was adopted as England's new Commonwealth Games anthem. In sports in which the UK competes as one nation, most notably as Great Britain at the Olympics, \"God Save the Queen\" is used to represent anyone or any team that comes from the United Kingdom.\n\nThe phrase \"God Save the King\" is much older than the song, appearing, for instance, several times in the King James Bible. A text based on the 1st Book of Kings Chapter 1: verses 38â40, \"...And all the people rejoic'd, and said: God save the King! Long live the King! May the King live for ever, Amen\", has been sung at every coronation since that of King Edgar in 973. Scholes says that as early as 1545 \"God Save the King\" was a watchword of the Royal Navy, with the response being \"Long to reign over us\". He also notes that the prayer read in churches on anniversaries of the Gunpowder Plot includes words which might have formed part of the basis for the second verse \"Scatter our enemies...assuage their malice and confound their devices\".\n\nIn 1745, \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" published \"God save our lord the king: A new song set for two voices\", describing it \"As sung at both Playhouses\" (the Theatres Royal at Drury Lane and Covent Garden). Traditionally, the first performance was thought to have been in 1745, when it was sung in support of King George II, after his defeat at the Battle of Prestonpans by the army of Charles Edward Stuart, son of James Francis Edward Stuart, the Jacobite claimant to the British throne.\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that, ironically, the song was originally sung in support of the Jacobite cause: the word \"send\" in the line \"Send him victorious\" could imply that the king was absent. However, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" cites examples of \"[God] send (a person) safe, victorious, etc.\" meaning \"God grant that he may be safe, etc.\". There are also examples of early eighteenth century Jacobean drinking glasses which are inscribed with a version of the words and were apparently intended for drinking the health of King James II and VII.\n\nScholes acknowledges these possibilities but argues that the same words were probably being used by both Jacobite and Hanoverian supporters and directed at their respective kings.\n\nIn 1902, the musician William Hayman Cummings, quoting mid-18th century correspondence between Charles Burney and Sir Joseph Banks, proposed that the words were based on a Latin verse composed for King James II at the Chapel Royal.\n\nThere is no definitive version of the lyrics. However, the version consisting of the three verses reproduced in the box on the right hand side has the best claim to be regarded as the \"standard\" British version, appearing not only in the 1745 \"Gentleman's Magazine\", but also in publications such as \"The Book of English Songs: From the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century\" (1851), \"National Hymns: How They Are Written and How They Are Not Written\" (1861), \"Household Book of Poetry\" (1882), and \"Hymns Ancient and Modern, Revised Version\" (1982).\n\nThe same version with verse two omitted appears in publications including \"Scouting for Boys\" (1908), and on the British Monarchy website. At the Queen's Golden Jubilee Party at the Palace concert, Prince Charles referred in his speech to the \"politically incorrect second verse\" of the National Anthem.\n\nAccording to Alan Michie's \"Rule, Britannia\", which was published in 1952, after the death of King George VI but before the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, when the first General Assembly of the United Nations was held in London in January 1946 the King, in honour of the occasion, \"ordered the belligerent imperious second stanza of 'God Save the King' to be rewritten to bring it more into the spirit of the brotherhood of nations.\"\n\nIn Britain, the first verse is the only verse typically sung, even at official occasions, although the third verse is sung in addition on rare occasions such as during the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics, and usually at the Last Night of the Proms. At the Closing Ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the fourth verse of the William Hickson alternative lyrics was sung instead of the third verse.\n\nThe standard version of the melody and its key of G major are still those of the originally published version, although the start of the anthem is often signalled by an introductory timpani roll of two bars length. The bass line of the standard version differs little from the second voice part shown in the original, and there is a standard version in four-part harmony for choirs. The first three lines (six bars of music) are soft, ending with a short \"crescendo\" into \"Send her victorious\", and then is another \"crescendo\" at \"over us:\" into the final words \"God save the Queen\".\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century there existed a Military Band version, usually played in march time, in the higher key of B, because it was easier for brass instruments to play in that key, though it had the disadvantage of being more difficult to sing: however now most Bands play it in the correct key of G.\n\nSince 1953, the anthem is sometimes preceded by a fanfare composed by Gordon Jacob for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThere have been several attempts to improve the song by rewriting the words. In the nineteenth century there was some lively debate about the national anthem and, even then, verse two was considered to be slightly offensive. Notably, the question arose over the phrase \"scatter her enemies.\" Some thought it placed better emphasis on the respective power of Parliament and the Crown to change \"her\" to \"our\"; others pointed out that the theology was somewhat dubious and substituted \"thine\" instead. Sydney G. R. Coles wrote a completely new version, as did Canon F. K. Harford. In 1836, William Edward Hickson wrote four alternative verses. The first, third, and fourth of these verses are appended to the National Anthem in the English Hymnal (which only includes verses one and three of the original lyrics).\n\nWilliam Hickson's alternative (1836) version includes the following verses, of which the first, third, and fourth have some currency as they are appended to the National Anthem in the English Hymnal. The fourth verse was sung after the traditional first verse at the Queen's Golden Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving in 2002 and during the raising of the Union Flag during the closing ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nA less militaristic version of the song, titled \"Official peace version, 1919\", was first published in the hymn book \"Songs of Praise\" in 1925. This was \"official\" in the sense that it was approved by the British Privy Council in 1919. However, despite being reproduced in some other hymn books, it is largely unknown today.\nAround 1745, anti-Jacobite sentiment was captured in a verse appended to the song, with a prayer for the success of Field Marshal George Wade's army then assembling at Newcastle. These words attained some short-term use, although they did not appear in the published version in the October 1745 \"Gentleman's Magazine\". This verse was first documented as an occasional addition to the original anthem by Richard Clark in 1822, and was also mentioned in a later article on the song, published by the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" in October 1836. Therein, it is presented as an \"additional verse... though being of temporary application only... stored in the memory of an old friend... who was born in the very year 1745, and was thus the associate of those who heard it first sung\", the lyrics given being:\n\nThe 1836 article and other sources make it clear that this verse was not used soon after 1745, and certainly before the song became accepted as the British national anthem in the 1780s and 1790s. It was included as an integral part of the song in the \"Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse\" of 1926, although erroneously referencing the \"fourth verse\" to the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" article of 1745.\n\nOn the opposing side, Jacobite beliefs were demonstrated in an alternative verse used during the same period:\n\nIn May 1800, following an attempt to assassinate King George III at London's Drury Lane theatre, playwright Richard Sheridan immediately composed an additional verse, which was sung from the stage the same night:\n\nVarious other attempts were made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to add verses to commemorate particular royal or national events. For example, according to Fitzroy Maclean, when Jacobite forces bypassed Wade's force and reached Derby, but then retreated and when their garrison at Carlisle Castle surrendered to a second government army led by King George's son, the Duke of Cumberland, another verse was added. Other short-lived verses were notably anti-French, such as the following, quoted in the book \"Handel\" by Edward J. Dent:\nHowever, none of these additional verses survived into the twentieth century. Updated \"full\" versions including additional verses have been published more recently, including the standard three verses, Hickson's fourth verse, Sheridan's verse and the Marshal Wade verse.\n\nThe style most commonly heard in official performances was proposed as the \"proper interpretation\" by King George V, who considered himself something of an expert (in view of the number of times he had heard it). An Army Order was duly issued in 1933, which laid down regulations for tempo, dynamics and orchestration. This included instructions such as that the opening \"six bars will be played quietly by the reed band with horns and basses in a single phrase. Cornets and side-drum are to be added at the little scale-passage leading into the second half of the tune, and the full brass enters for the last eight bars\". The official tempo for the opening section is a metronome setting of 60, with the second part played in a broader manner, at a metronome setting of 52. In recent years the prescribed sombre-paced introduction is often played at a faster and livelier tempo.\n\nUntil the latter part of the 20th century, theatre and concert goers were expected to stand while the anthem was played after the conclusion of a show. In cinemas this brought a tendency for audiences to rush out while the end credits played to avoid this formality. (This can be seen in the 1972 Dad's Army episode A Soldier's Farewell.)\n\nThe anthem continues to be played at some traditional events such as Wimbledon, Royal Variety Performance, the Edinburgh Tattoo, Royal Ascot, Henley Royal Regatta and The Proms.\n\nThe anthem was traditionally played at closedown on the BBC, and with the introduction of commercial television to Britain this practice was adopted by some ITV companies (with the notable exception of Granada). BBC Two never played the anthem at closedown, and ITV dropped the practice in the late 1980s, but it continued on BBC One until the final closedown on 8 November 1997 (thereafter BBC1 began to simulcast with BBC News after end of programmes). The tradition is carried on, however, by BBC Radio 4, which plays the anthem each night as a transition piece between the end of the Radio Four broadcasting and the move to BBC World Service. Radio 4 and Radio 2 also play the National Anthem at 0700 and 0800 on the actual and official birthdays of the Queen and the birthdays of senior members of the Royal Family.\n\nThe anthem usually prefaces The Queen's Christmas Message (although in 2007 it appeared at the end, taken from a recording of the 1957 television broadcast), and important royal announcements, such as of royal deaths, when it is played in a slower, sombre arrangement.\n\nFrequently, when an anthem is needed for one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom at an international sporting event, for instance an alternative song is used:\n\n\nIn April 2007 there was an early day motion, number 1319, to the British Parliament to propose that there should be a separate England anthem: \"That this House ... believes that all English sporting associations should adopt an appropriate song that English sportsmen and women, and the English public, would favour when competing as England\". An amendment (EDM 1319A3) was proposed by Evan Harris that the song \"should have a bit more oomph than \"God Save The Queen\" and should also not involve God.\"\n\nFor more information see also:\n\n\"God Save the King/Queen\" was exported around the world via the expansion of the British Empire, serving as each country's national anthem. Throughout the Empire's evolution into the Commonwealth of Nations, the song declined in use in most states which became independent. In some countries it remains as one of the official national anthems, such as in New Zealand, or as an official royal anthem, as is the case in Australia, Canada, Jamaica, and Tuvalu, to be played during formal ceremonies involving national royalty or vice-royalty.\n\nIn Australia, the song has standing through a Royal Proclamation issued by Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen on 19 April 1984. It declared \"God Save the Queen\" to be the Royal Anthem and that it is to be played when the Australian monarch or a member of the Royal Family is present, though not exclusively in such circumstances. The same proclamation made \"Advance Australia Fair\" the national anthem and the basis for the \"Vice-Regal Salute\" (the first four and last two bars of the anthem). Prior to 1974, \"God Save the Queen\" was the national anthem of Australia.\n\nBy convention, \"God Save the Queen\" is the Royal Anthem of Canada. It is sometimes played and/or sung together with the national anthem, \"O Canada\", at private and public events organised by groups such as the Government of Canada, the Royal Canadian Legion, police services, and loyal groups. The governor general and provincial lieutenant governors are accorded the \"Viceregal Salute\", comprising the first three lines of \"God Save the Queen\", followed by the first and last lines of \"O Canada\".\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" has been sung in Canada since the late 1700s and by the mid 20th century was, along with \"O Canada\", one of the country's two \"de facto\" national anthems, the first and last verses of the standard British version being used. By-laws and practices governing the use of either song during public events in municipalities varied; in Toronto, \"God Save the Queen\" was employed, while in Montreal it was \"O Canada\". Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1964 said one song would have to be chosen as the country's national anthem and, three years later, he advised Governor General Georges Vanier to appoint the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the National and Royal Anthems. Within two months, on 12 April 1967, the committee presented its conclusion that \"God Save the Queen\", whose music and lyrics were found to be in the public domain, should be designated as the Royal Anthem of Canada and \"O Canada\" as the national anthem, one verse from each, in both official languages, to be adopted by parliament. The group was then charged with establishing official lyrics for each song; for \"God Save the Queen\", the English words were those inherited from the United Kingdom and the French words were taken from those that had been adopted in 1952 for the coronation of Elizabeth II. When the bill pronouncing \"O Canada\" as the national anthem was put through parliament, the joint committee's earlier recommendations regarding \"God Save the Queen\" were not included.\n\nThe Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces regulates that \"God Save the Queen\" be played as a salute to the monarch and other members of the Canadian Royal Family, though it may also be used as a hymn, or prayer. The words are not to be sung when the song is played as a military royal salute and is abbreviated to the first three lines while arms are being presented. Elizabeth II stipulated that the arrangement in G major by Lieutenant Colonel Basil H. Brown be used in Canada. The authorised version to be played by pipe bands is \"Mallorca\".\n\nThe first verse of \"God Save the Queen\" has been translated into French, as shown below:\n\nThere is a special Canadian verse in English which was once commonly sung in addition to the two standing verses:\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" was the sole official national anthem until 1977 when \"God Defend New Zealand\" was added as a second. \"God Save the Queen\" is now most often only played when the sovereign, governor-general or other member of the Royal Family is present, or on some occasions such as Anzac Day.\n\nIn New Zealand, the second more militaristic verse is sometimes replaced with Hickson's verse \"Nor in this land alone...\" (often sung as \"\"Not\" in this land alone\"), otherwise known as a \"Commonwealth verse\".\n\nWhen Rhodesia issued its Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain on 11 November 1965, it did so while still maintaining loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II as the Rhodesian head of state, despite the non-recognition of the Rhodesian government by the United Kingdom and the United Nations; \"God Save the Queen\" therefore remained the Rhodesian national anthem. This was supposed to demonstrate the continued allegiance of the Rhodesian people to the monarch, but the retention in Rhodesia of a song so associated with Britain while the two countries were at loggerheads regarding its constitutional status caused Rhodesian state occasions to have \"a faintly ironic tone\", in the words of \"The Times\". Nevertheless, \"God Save the Queen\" remained Rhodesia's national anthem until March 1970, when the country formally declared itself a republic. \"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\" was adopted in its stead in 1974 and remained in use until the country returned to British control in December 1979. Since the internationally recognised independence of the Republic of Zimbabwe in April 1980, \"God Save the Queen\" has had no official status there.\n\n\"God Save the King\" was one of the first songs to successfully be used as a national anthem, only the Dutch \"Het Wilhelmus\" (~1568) is older. (The Spanish \"La Marcha Real\" is older as well, but took longer to become popular. Japan's anthem \"Kimigayo\" has lyrics which are older still, but a more recent melody). Its success prompted a number of other countries to pen similar anthems to help construct a concrete national identity - many of which used the same tune:\n\n\nThe melody is also used as a hymn tune by Christian churches in various countries, including by the United Methodists of the southern United States, Mexico, and Latin America, among other denominations. \"Glory to God on High\" is frequently sung to the tune, as is \"Since I Have My Retreat\" in the Protestant Church of Korea, and the Dutch hymn \"Eeuwig en machtig Heer\".\n\n\"The Ren & Stimpy Show\" uses a parody version of the tune for the anthem of the \"Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen\".\n\nAbout 140 composers have used the tune in their compositions, including Beethoven, Haydn, Brahms, Clementi, J. C. Bach, Liszt, Britten, Carl Maria von Weber, NiccolÃ² Paganini, Johann Strauss I, and Edward Elgar.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven composed a set of seven piano variations in the key of C major to the theme of \"God Save the King\", catalogued as WoO.78 (1802â1803). He also quotes it in his orchestral work \"Wellington's Victory\".\n\nMuzio Clementi used the theme to \"God Save the King\" in his \"Symphony No. 3 in G major\", often called the \"Great National Symphony\", catalogued as WoO. 34.\nClementi paid a high tribute to his adopted homeland (the United Kingdom) where he grew up and stayed most of his lifetime. He based the Symphony (about 1816â1824) on \"God Save the King\", which is hinted at earlier in the work, not least in the second movement, and announced by the trombones in the finale.\nâ¢ Symphony No. 3 \" Great National Symphony \" in en sol majeur/G-dur/G major/sol maggiore\n1. Andante sostenuto â Allegro con brio\n2. Andante un poco mosso\n3. Minuetto. Allegretto\n4. Finale. Vivace\n\nJohann Christian Bach composed a set of variations on \"God Save the King\" for the finale to his sixth keyboard concerto (Op. 1) written c. 1763.\n\nJoseph Haydn was impressed by the use of \"God Save the King\" as a national anthem during his visit to London in 1794, and on his return to Austria composed \"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\" (\"God Save Emperor Francis\") for the birthday of the last Holy Roman Emperor and Roman-German King, Francis II. It became the anthem of the Austrian Empire after the end of the Holy Roman Empire with revised lyrics, its tune ultimately being used for the German national anthem. The tune of \"God Save the King\" was adopted for the Prussian royal anthem \"Heil Dir im Siegerkranz\".\n\nFranz Liszt wrote a piano paraphrase on the anthem (S.259 in the official catalogue, c. 1841).\n\nJohann Strauss I quoted \"God Save the Queen\" in full at the end of his waltz \"Huldigung der KÃ¶nigin Victoria von Grossbritannien\" (Homage to Queen Victoria of Great Britain) Op. 103, where he also quoted \"Rule, Britannia!\" in full at the beginning of the piece.\n\nSiegfried August Mahlmann in the early 19th century wrote alternate lyrics to adapt the hymn for the Kingdom of Saxony, as \"Gott segne Sachsenland\" (\"God Bless Saxony\").\n\nHeinrich Marschner used the anthem in his \"Grande Ouverture solenne\", op.78 (1842).\n\nGaetano Donizetti used this anthem in his opera \"Roberto Devereux\".\n\nJoachim Raff used this anthem in his Jubelouverture, Opus 103 (1864) dedicated to Adolf, Herzog von Nassau, on the 25th anniversary of his reign.\n\nGioachino Rossini used this anthem in the last scene of his \"Il viaggio a Reims\", when all the characters, coming from many different European countries, sing a song which recalls their own homeland. Lord Sidney, bass, sings \"Della real pianta\" on the notes of \"God Save the King\". Samuel Ramey used to interpolate a spectacular virtuoso cadenza at the end of the song.\n\nFernando Sor used the anthem in his 12 Studies, Op. 6: No. 10 in C Major in the section marked 'Maestoso.'\n\nArthur Sullivan quotes the anthem at the end of his ballet \"Victoria and Merrie England\".\n\nClaude Debussy opens with a brief introduction of \"God Save the King\" in one of his Preludes, \"Hommage Ã  S. Pickwick Esq. P.P.M.P.C.\" The piece draws its inspiration from the main character of the Charles Dickens novel \"The Pickwick Papers\".\n\nNiccolÃ² Paganini wrote a set of highly virtuosic variations on \"God Save the King\" as his Opus 9.\n\nMax Reger wrote \"Variations and Fugue on 'Heil dir im Siegerkranz' (God Save the King)\" for organ in 1901 after the death of Queen Victoria. It does not have an opus number.\n\nA week before the Coronation Ode was due to be premiered at the June 1902 \"Coronation Gala Concert\" at Covent Garden (it was cancelled, owing to the King's illness), Sir Edward Elgar introduced an arrangement of \"Land of Hope and Glory\" as a solo song performed by Clara Butt at a \"Coronation Concert\" at the Albert Hall. Novello seized upon the prevailing patriotism and requested that Elgar arrange the National Anthem as an appropriate opening for a concert performed in front of the Court and numerous British and foreign dignitaries. This version for orchestra and chorus, which is enlivened by use of \"a cappella\" and marcato effects, was also performed at the opening of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on St. Georgeâs Day, 1924, and recorded under the composer's Baton in 1928, with the LSO and the Philharmonic Choir. Elgar also used the first verse of the Anthem as the climax of a short \"Civic Procession and Anthem\", written to accompany the mayoral procession at the opening of the Hereford Music Festival on 4 September 1927. This premiere performance was recorded, and is today available on CD; the score was lost following the festival, and Elgar resorted to reconstructing it by ear from the recording.\n\nCarl Maria von Weber uses the \"God Save the King\" theme at the end of his \"Jubel Overture\"\n\nGiuseppe Verdi included \"God Save the Queen\" in his \"Inno delle nazioni\" (Hymn of the Nations), composed for the London 1862 International Exhibition.\n\nBenjamin Britten arranged \"God Save the Queen\" in 1961 for the Leeds Festival. This version has been programmed several times at the Last Night of the Proms.\n\nCharles Ives wrote \"Variations on \"America\"\" for organ in 1891 at age seventeen. It included a polytonal section in three simultaneous keys, though this was omitted from performances at his father's request, because \"it made the boys laugh out loud\". Ives was fond of the rapid pedal line in the final variation, which he said was \"almost as much fun as playing baseball\". The piece was not published until 1949; the final version includes an introduction, seven variations and a polytonal interlude. The piece was adapted for orchestra in 1963 by William Schuman. This version became popular during the bicentennial celebrations, and is often heard at pops concerts.\n\nMuthuswami Dikshitar (1776â1835), one of the musical trinity in South Indian classical (Carnatic) music composed some Sanskrit pieces set to Western tunes. These are in the raga Sankarabharanam and are referred to as \"nottu swaras\". Among these, the composition \"Santatam Pahimam Sangita Shyamale\" is set to the tune of \"God Save the Queen\"\n\nSigismond Thalberg (1812-1871) Swiss composer and one of the most famous virtuoso pianists of the 19th century wrote a fantasia on \"God Save the Queen\".\n\nJohan Nepomuk Hummel (1778-1837) Variations from God Save the King in D major op10\n\nAdrien-FranÃ§ois Servais (1807â66) and Joseph Ghys (1801â48) wrote \"Variations brillantes et concertantes sur l'air \"God Save the King\"\", Op. 38, for violin and cello and performed it in London and St Petersburg.\n\nGeorges Onslow (1784-1853) used the tune in his String Quartet No. 7 in G Minor, op.9, second movement.\n\nThe British rock band Family sampled \"God Save the Queen\" at the end of their 1968 debut album, \"Music in a Doll's House\", following the final track, \"3 x Time\".\n\nThe Beatles performed an impromptu version of \"God Save the Queen\" during their 30 January 1969 rooftop concert, atop the Apple building. They had also whistled the melody of the song on their first fan club Christmas record in 1963.\n\nJimi Hendrix of The Jimi Hendrix Experience played an impromptu version of \"God Save the Queen\" to open his set at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970. Just before walking onto the stage, he can be seen (on the DVD) and heard to ask \"How does it go again?\" in reference to said UK national anthem. He may have been able to simply hear it mimicked by voice and then perform it, though the same melody was (and is) widely known in the United States to the lyrics \"My country, 'tis of thee\". Hendrix gave the same sort of distortion and improvisation of \"God Save the Queen\", as he had done with \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the Woodstock Festival, 1969.\n\nGentle Giant performed a versionâtitled \"The Queen\"âon their 1970 eponymous debut album.\n\nThe rock band Queen recorded an instrumental version of \"God Save the Queen\" on their 1975 album \"A Night at the Opera\". It was arranged by guitarist Brian May and features his distinctive layers of overdubbed electric guitars. A tape of this version would be played at the end of almost every concert, with Freddie Mercury walking around the stage wearing a crown and a cloak on their Magic Tour in 1986. The song was played whilst all the Queen members would take their bows. On 3 June 2002, during the Queen's Golden Jubilee, Brian May performed the anthem on his Red Special electric guitar for Party at the Palace, performing from the roof of Buckingham Palace, and features on the 30th Anniversary DVD edition of \"A Night at the Opera\". \n\nIn 1977, the Sex Pistols recorded a song titled \"God Save the Queen\" in open reference to the National Anthem and the Queen's Silver Jubilee celebrations that year, with the song intending to stand for sympathy for the working class and resentment of the monarchy. They were banned from many venues, censored by mainstream media, and reached number 2 on the official U.K. singles charts and number 1 on the NME chart.\n\nA version of \"God Save the Queen\" by Madness features the melody of the song played on kazoos. It was included on the compilation album \"The Business â the Definitive Singles Collection\".\n\nComposer Steve Ouimette recorded a rock version as downloadable content for the video game \"Guitar Hero 5\".\n\nCanadian rocker Neil Young recorded a rock version of \"God Save the Queen\", merged with \"America (My Country 'Tis of Thee)\", for his 2012 Americana album with Crazy Horse.\n\nThe philosopher and reformer Jeremy Bentham praised \"God Save the King\" in 1796: \"the melody recommending itself by beauty to the most polished ears, and by its simplicity to the rudest ear. A song of this complexion, implanted by the habit of half a century in the mass of popular sentiment, can not be refused a place in the inventory of the national blessings.\" Ludwig van Beethoven wrote \"I have to show the English a little of what a blessing 'God Save the King' is\". Alex Marshall, the British author of \"Republic or Death!: Travels in Search of National Anthems\", called the anthem \"ludicrous\".\n\n", "id": "12334", "title": "God Save the Queen"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12336", "text": "Gladiator\n\nA gladiator (, \"swordsman\", from , \"sword\") was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death.\n\nIrrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world.\n\nThe origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate. There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the Punic Wars of the 3rd century BC, and thereafter it rapidly became an essential feature of politics and social life in the Roman world. Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly games.\n\nThe gladiator games lasted for nearly a thousand years, reaching their peak between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD. The games finally declined during the early 5th century after the adoption of Christianity as state church of the Roman Empire in 380, although beast hunts (\"venationes\") continued into the 6th century.\n\nEarly literary sources seldom agree on the origins of gladiators and the gladiator games. In the late 1st century BC, Nicolaus of Damascus believed they were Etruscan. A generation later, Livy wrote that they were first held in 310 BC by the Campanians in celebration of their victory over the Samnites. Long after the games had ceased, the 7th century AD writer Isidore of Seville derived Latin \"lanista\" (manager of gladiators) from the Etruscan word for \"executioner,\" and the title of Charon (an official who accompanied the dead from the Roman gladiatorial arena) from Charun, psychopomp of the Etruscan underworld. Roman historians emphasized the gladiator games as a foreign import, most likely Etruscan. This preference informed most standard histories of the Roman games in the early modern era.\n\nReappraisal of the evidence supports a Campanian origin, or at least a borrowing, for the games and gladiators. The earliest known Roman gladiator schools (\"ludi\") were in Campania. Tomb frescoes from Paestum (4th century BC) show paired fighters, with helmets, spears and shields, in a propitiatory funeral blood-rite that anticipates early Roman gladiator games. Compared to these images, supporting evidence from Etruscan tomb-paintings is tentative and late. The Paestum frescoes may represent the continuation of a much older tradition, acquired or inherited from Greek colonists of the 8th century BC.\n\nLivy dates the earliest Roman gladiator games to 264 BC, in the early stages of Rome's First Punic War against Carthage. Decimus Iunius Brutus Scaeva had three gladiator pairs fight to the death in Rome's \"cattle market\" Forum (\"Forum Boarium\") to honor his dead father, Brutus Pera. This is described as a \"munus\" (plural: \"munera\"), a commemorative duty owed the manes of a dead ancestor by his descendants. The gladiator type used (according to a single, later source), was Thracian, but the development of the \"munus\" and its gladiator types was most strongly influenced by Samnium's support for Hannibal and subsequent punitive expeditions by Rome and her Campanian allies; the earliest and most frequently mentioned type was the Samnite.\nThe war in Samnium, immediately afterwards, was attended with equal danger and an equally glorious conclusion. The enemy, besides their other warlike preparation, had made their battle-line to glitter with new and splendid arms. There were two corps: the shields of the one were inlaid with gold, of the other with silverÂ ... The Romans had already heard of these splendid accoutrements, but their generals had taught them that a soldier should be rough to look on, not adorned with gold and silver but putting his trust in iron and in courageÂ ... The Dictator, as decreed by the senate, celebrated a triumph, in which by far the finest show was afforded by the captured armour. So the Romans made use of the splendid armour of their enemies to do honour to their gods; while the Campanians, in consequence of their pride and in hatred of the Samnites, equipped after this fashion the gladiators who furnished them entertainment at their feasts, and bestowed on them the name Samnites. (Livy 9.40)\nLivy's account skirts the funereal, sacrificial function of early Roman gladiator combats and underlines the later theatrical ethos of the gladiator show: splendidly, exotically armed and armoured barbarians, treacherous and degenerate, are dominated by Roman iron and native courage. His plain Romans virtuously dedicate the magnificent spoils of war to the Gods. Their Campanian allies stage a dinner entertainment using gladiators who may not be Samnites, but play the Samnite role. Other groups and tribes would join the cast list as Roman territories expanded. Most gladiators were armed and armoured in the manner of the enemies of Rome. The \"munus\" became a morally instructive form of historic enactment in which the only honourable option for the gladiator was to fight well, or else die well.\n\nIn 216 BC, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, late consul and augur, was honoured by his sons with three days of \"gladiatora munera\" in the Forum Romanum, using twenty-two pairs of gladiators. Ten years later, Scipio Africanus gave a commemorative \"munus\" in Iberia for his father and uncle, casualties in the Punic Wars. High status non-Romans, and possibly Romans too, volunteered as his gladiators. The context of the Punic Wars and Rome's near-disastrous defeat at the Battle of Cannae (216 BC) link these early games to munificence, the celebration of military victory and the religious expiation of military disaster; these \"munera\" appear to serve a morale-raising agenda in an era of military threat and expansion. The next recorded \"munus\", held for the funeral of Publius Licinius in 183 BC, was more extravagant. It involved three days of funeral games, 120 gladiators, and public distribution of meat (\"visceratio data\")Â â a practice that reflected the gladiatorial fights at Campanian banquets described by Livy and later deplored by Silius Italicus.\n\nThe enthusiastic adoption of \"gladiatoria munera\" by Rome's Iberian allies shows how easily, and how early, the culture of the gladiator \"munus\" permeated places far from Rome itself. By 174 BC, \"small\" Roman \"munera\" (private or public), provided by an \"editor\" of relatively low importance, may have been so commonplace and unremarkable they were not considered worth recording:\nMany gladiatorial games were given in that year, some unimportant, one noteworthy beyond the restÂ â that of Titus Flamininus which he gave to commemorate the death of his father, which lasted four days, and was accompanied by a public distribution of meats, a banquet, and scenic performances. The climax of the show which was big for the time was that in three days seventy four gladiators fought.\nIn 105 BC, the ruling consuls offered Rome its first taste of state-sponsored \"barbarian combat\" demonstrated by gladiators from Capua, as part of a training program for the military. It proved immensely popular. The \"ludi\" (state games), sponsored by the ruling elite and dedicated to a deity such as Jupiter, a divine or heroic ancestor (and later, during the Imperium, the well-being and numen of the emperor), began to include the gladiator contests formerly restricted to private \"munera\".\n\nBy the closing years of the politically and socially unstable Late Republic, gladiator games provided their sponsors with extravagantly expensive but effective opportunities for self-promotion while offering cheap, exciting entertainment to their clients. Gladiators became big business for trainers and owners, for politicians on the make and those who had reached the top. A politically ambitious \"privatus\" (private citizen) might postpone his deceased father's \"munus\" to the election season, when a generous show might drum up votes; those in power and those seeking it needed the support of the plebeians and their tribunes, whose votes might be won with an exceptionally spectacular show, sometimes even the mere promise of one. Sulla, during his term as praetor, showed his usual acumen in breaking his own sumptuary laws to give the most lavish \"munus\" yet seen in Rome, on occasion of his wife's funeral.\n\nOwnership of gladiators or a gladiator school gave muscle and flair to Roman politics. In 65 BC, newly elected curule aedile Julius Caesar topped Sulla's display with games he justified as \"munus\" to his father, who had died twenty years before. Despite an already enormous personal debt, he used three hundred and twenty gladiator pairs in silvered armour. He had wanted more but the nervous Senate, mindful of the recent Spartacus revolt, fearful of Caesar's burgeoning private armies and even more fearful of his overwhelming popularity, imposed a limit of 320 pairs as the maximum number of gladiators a citizen could keep in Rome. Caesar's showmanship was unprecedented not only in scale and expense but in putting aside a Republican tradition of \"munera\" as funeral offerings. The practical differences between \"ludi\" and \"munera\" were beginning to blur.\n\nGladiatorial games, usually linked with beast shows, spread throughout the Republic and beyond. Anti-corruption laws of 65 and 63 BC attempted but signally failed to curb their political usefulness to sponsors. Following Caesar's assassination and the Roman Civil War, Augustus assumed Imperial authority over the games, including \"munera\", and formalised their provision as a civic and religious duty. His revision of sumptuary law capped private and public expenditure on \"munera\", claiming to save the Roman elite from the bankruptcies they would otherwise suffer, and restricted their performance to the festivals of Saturnalia and Quinquatria. Henceforth, the ceiling cost for a praetor's \"economical\" official \"munus\" employing a maximum 120 gladiators was to be 25,000 denarii; a \"generous\" Imperial \"ludi\" might cost no less than 180,000 denarii. Throughout the Empire, the greatest and most celebrated games would now be identified with the state-sponsored Imperial cult, which furthered public recognition, respect and approval for the Emperor, his law, and his agents. Between 108 and 109 AD, Trajan celebrated his Dacian victories using a reported 10,000 gladiators (and 11,000 animals) over 123 days. The cost of gladiators and \"munera\" continued to spiral out of control. Legislation of 177 AD by Marcus Aurelius did little to stop it, and was completely ignored by his son, Commodus.\n\nThe decline of the \"munus\" was a far from straightforward process. The crisis of the 3rd century imposed increasing military demands on the imperial purse, from which the Roman Empire never quite recovered, and lesser magistrates found the obligatory \"munera\" an increasingly unrewarding tax on the doubtful privileges of office. Still, emperors continued to subsidize the games as a matter of undiminished public interest. In the early 3rd century AD, the Christian writer Tertullian had acknowledged their power over the Christian flock, and was compelled to be blunt: the combats were murder, their witnessing spiritually and morally harmful and the gladiator an instrument of pagan human sacrifice. In the next century, Augustine deplored the youthful fascination of his friend (and later fellow-convert and Bishop) Alypius, with the \"munera\" spectacle as inimical to a Christian life and salvation. Amphitheatres continued to host the spectacular administration of Imperial justice: in 315 Constantine I condemned child-snatchers \"ad bestias\" in the arena. Ten years later, he banned the gladiator \"munera\":\nIn times in which peace and peace relating to domestic affairs prevail bloody demonstrations displease us. Therefore, we order that there may be no more gladiator combats. Those who were condemned to become gladiators for their crimes are to work from now on in the mines. Thus they pay for their crimes without having to pour their blood.\n\nAn imperially sanctioned \"munus\" at some time in the 330s suggests that yet again, imperial legislation to curb the games proved ineffective, not least when Constantine defied his own law. In 365, Valentinian I (r. 364â375) threatened to fine a judge who sentenced Christians to the arena and in 384 he attempted, like most of his predecessors, to limit the expenses of \"munera\".\n\nIn 393, Theodosius (r. 379â395) adopted Nicene Christianity as the state church of the Roman Empire and banned pagan festivals. The \"ludi\" continued, very gradually shorn of their stubbornly pagan \"munera\". Honorius (r. 395â423) legally ended \"munera\" in 399, and again in 404, at least in the Western half of the Empire according to Theodoret, because of the martyrdom of Saint Telemachus by spectators at a \"munus.\" Valentinian III (r. 425â455) repeated the ban in 438, perhaps effectively, though \"venationes\" continued beyond 536. By this time, the popularity of \"munera\" had waned, unlike the theatrical shows, and the chariot races which, at least in the Eastern Empire, continued to attract the crowds, and a generous Imperial subsidy.\n\nIt is not known how many \"gladiatoria munera\" were given throughout the Roman period. Many, if not most, involved \"venationes\", and in the later Empire some may have been only that. In the early Imperial era, the attested munera given by local politicians in Pompeii and neighbouring towns were dispersed from March to November. They included a provincial magnate's five-day munus of thirty pairs, plus beast-hunts. One single late primary source, the \"Calendar of Furius Dionysius Philocalus\" for 354, survives to suggest how the gladiator featured among a multitude of official festivals in the Late Empire period. In that year, 176 days were reserved for spectacles of various kinds. Of these, 102 days were for theatrical shows, 64 for chariot races and just 10 in December for gladiator games and \"venationes\". Thomas Wiedemann interprets this in the much earlier context of the Historia Augusta, in which Alexander Severus (r. 222â235) was said to intend the redistribution of \"munera\" throughout the year. This would have broken with the traditional positioning of the major gladiator games at the year's end: as Wiedemann points out, December was the month for Saturnalia, the festival in which the lowest became the highest, and in which death was linked to renewal.\n\nThe trade in gladiators was Empire-wide, and subjected to official supervision. Rome's military success produced a supply of soldier-prisoners who were redistributed for use in State mines or amphitheatres and for sale on the open market. For example, in the aftermath of the Jewish Revolt, the gladiator schools received an influx of JewsÂ â those rejected for training would have been sent straight to the arenas as \"noxii\" (lit. \"hurtful ones\"). The bestÂ â the most robustÂ â were sent to Rome. In Rome's military ethos, enemy soldiers who had surrendered or allowed their own capture and enslavement had been granted an unmerited gift of life. Their training as gladiators would give them opportunity to redeem their honour in the \"munus\".\n\nTwo other sources of gladiators, found increasingly during the Principate and the relatively low military activity of the Pax Romana, were slaves condemned to the arena, to gladiator schools or games (\"ad ludum gladiatorium\") as punishment for crimes, and paid volunteers (\"auctorati\") who by the late Republic may have comprised approximately halfÂ â and possibly the most capable halfÂ â of all gladiators. The use of volunteers had a precedent in the Iberian \"munus\" of Scipio Africanus; but none of those had been paid. For Romans, \"gladiator\" would have meant a schooled fighter, sworn and contracted to a master.\n\nFor the poor, and for non-citizens, enrollment in a gladiator school offered a trade, regular food, housing of sorts and a fighting chance of fame and fortune. Gladiators customarily kept their prize money and any gifts they received, and these could be substantial. Tiberius offered several retired gladiators 100,000 \"sesterces\" ($500,000) each to return to the arena. Nero gave the gladiator Spiculus property and residence \"equal to those of men who had celebrated triumphs.\" Mark Antony promoted gladiators to his personal guard.\n\nFrom the 60s AD female gladiators appear, as \"exotic markers of exceptionally lavish spectacle\". In 66 AD, Nero had Ethiopian women, men and children fight at a \"munus\" to impress King Tiridates I of Armenia. Romans seem to have found the idea of a female gladiator novel and entertaining, or downright absurd; Juvenal titillates his readers with a woman named \"Mevia\", hunting boars in the arena \"with spear in hand and breasts exposed\", and Petronius mocks the pretensions of a rich, low-class citizen, whose \"munus\" includes a woman fighting from a cart or chariot. A \"munus\" of 89 AD, during Domitian's reign, featured a battle between female gladiators, described as \"Amazons\". In Halicarnassus, a 2nd-century AD relief depicts two female combatants named \"Amazon\" and \"Achillia\"; their match ended in a draw. In the same century, an epigraph praises one of Ostia's local elite as the first to \"arm women\" in the history of its games. Female gladiators probably submitted to the same regulations and training as their male counterparts. Roman morality required that all gladiators be of the lowest social classes, and emperors who failed to respect this distinction earned the scorn of posterity; Cassius Dio takes pains to point out that when the much admired emperor Titus used female gladiators, they were of acceptably low class.\n\nSome regarded female gladiators as a symptom of corrupted Roman sensibilities, morals and womanhood, regardless of class. Before he became emperor, Septimius Severus may have attended the Antiochene Olympic Games, which had been revived by the emperor Commodus and included traditional Greek female athletics. His attempt to give Rome a similarly dignified display of female athletics was met by the crowd with ribald chants and cat-calls. Probably as a result, he banned the use of female gladiators in 200 AD.\n\nCaligula, Titus, Hadrian, Lucius Verus, Caracalla, Geta and Didius Julianus were all said to have performed in the arena (either in public or private) but risks to themselves were minimal. Claudius, characterised by his historians as morbidly cruel and boorish, fought a whale trapped in the harbor in front of a group of spectators. Commentators invariably disapproved of such performances.\n\nCommodus was a fanatical participant at the \"ludi\", much to the shame of the Senate, whom he loathed, and the probable delight of the populace at large. He fought as a \"secutor\", styling himself \"Hercules Reborn\". As a \"bestiarius\", he was said to have killed 100 lions in one day, almost certainly from a platform set up around the arena perimeter which allowed him to safely demonstrate his marksmanship. On another occasion, he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart, carried the bloodied head and his sword over to the Senatorial seats and gesticulated as though they were next. He was said to have restyled Nero's colossal statue in his own image as \"Hercules Reborn\" and re-dedicated it to himself with the inscription; \"Champion of \"secutores\"; only left-handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men.\" For this, he drew a gigantic stipend from the public purse.\n\nThe earliest \"munera\" took place at or near the tomb of the deceased and these were organised by their \"munerator\" (who made the offering). Later games were held by an \"editor\", either identical with the \"munerator\" or an official employed by him. As time passed, these titles and meanings may have merged. In the Republican era, private citizens could own and train gladiators, or lease them from a \"lanista\" (owner of a gladiator training school). From the Principate onwards, private citizens could hold munera and own gladiators only under Imperial permission, and the role of \"editor\" was increasingly tied to state officialdom.\n\nLegislation by Claudius required that quaestors, the lowest rank of Roman magistrate, personally subsidise two-thirds of the costs of games for their small-town communitiesÂ â in effect, both an advertisement of their personal generosity and a part-purchase of their office. Bigger games were put on by senior magistrates, who could better afford them. The largest and most lavish of all were paid for by the emperor himself. An outline of these later games can be conjectured, using written histories, contemporary accounts, statuary, ephemera, memorabilia and stylised pictographic evidence. Almost all the evidence comes from the Late Republic and Empire, and much of it from Pompeii.\n\nGames were advertised beforehand on conspicuously placed billboards, giving the reason for the game, its editor, venue, date and the number of paired gladiators (\"ordinarii\") to be used. Other highlighted features could include details of \"venationes\", executions, music and any luxuries to be provided for the spectators, including a decorated awning against the sun, and water sprinklers. Food, drink, sweets and occasionally \"door prizes\" could be offered. For enthusiasts, a more detailed program (\"libellus\") was prepared for the day of the \"munus\", showing the names, types and match records of gladiator pairs (of interest to gamblers) and their order of appearance. Copies of the \"libellus\" were distributed among the crowd on the day of the match. Left-handed gladiators were advertised as an interesting rarity; they were trained to fight right-handers, which gave them advantage over most opponents and produced an interestingly unorthodox combination.\n\nThe night before the \"munus\", the gladiators were given a banquet and opportunity to order their personal and private affairs; Futrell notes its similarity to a ritualistic \"last meal\". These were probably both family and public events which included even the \"noxii\" and \"damnati\" and they may have been used to drum up more publicity for the coming match.\n\nFrom Augustus's time, official \"munera\" seem to have followed a standard sequence. A procession (\"pompa\") entered the arena led by lictors bearing fasces that signified the magistrate-\"editor\"'s power over life and death. They were followed by a small band of trumpeters (\"tubicines\") playing a fanfare. Images of the gods were carried in to \"witness\" the proceedings, followed by a scribe (to record the outcome) and a man carrying the palm branch used to honour victors. The magistrate \"editor\" entered among a retinue who carried the arms and armour to be used; more musicians followed, then horses. The gladiators presumably came in last.\n\nThese official games usually began with \"venationes\" (beast hunts) and \"bestiarii\" (beast fighting) gladiators. Sometimes beasts were unharmed and simply exhibited. Next came the \"ludi meridiani\", of variable content but usually involving executions of \"noxii\" (sometimes as \"mythological\" re-enactments) or others condemned \"(damnati)\" to the arena. Gladiators may have been involved in these though the crowd, and the gladiators themselves, preferred the \"dignity\" of an even contest. There were also comedy fights; some may have been lethal. A crude Pompeian graffito suggests a burlesque of musicians, dressed as animals named \"Ursus tibicen\" (flute-playing bear) and \"Pullus cornicen\" (horn-blowing chicken), perhaps as accompaniment to clowning by \"paegniarii\" during a \"mock\" contest of the \"ludi meridiani\".\n\nBefore the listed contests were fought, the gladiators may have held informal warm-up matches, using blunted or dummy weaponsÂ â some \"munera\", however, may have used blunted weapons throughout. The \"editor,\" his representative or an honoured guest would check the weapons (\"probatio armorum\") for the scheduled matches. These were the highlight of the day, and were as inventive, varied and novel as the \"editor\" could afford. Armatures could be very costlyÂ â some were flamboyantly decorated with exotic feathers, jewels and precious metals. Increasingly the \"munus\" was the \"editor\"'s gift to spectators who had come to expect the best as their due. In late Republican \"munera\", between 10 and 13 pairs could have fought on one day; this assumes one match at a time in the course of an afternoon. Fights were interspersed or accompanied by music, perhaps intended to accentuate or follow the action. Music may have heightened the suspense during a gladiator's appeal; blows may have been accompanied by trumpet-blasts. The gravestones of several musicians and gladiators mention such modulations. The Zliten mosaic in Libya (circa 80â100 AD) shows musicians playing an accompaniment to provincial games (with gladiators, \"bestiarii\", or \"venatores\" and prisoners attacked by beasts). Their instruments are a long straight trumpet (\"tubicen\"), a large curved horn (\"Cornu\") and a water organ (\"hydraulis\"). Similar representations (musicians, gladiators and \"bestiari\") are found on a tomb relief in Pompeii.\n\nIn the earliest \"munera\", death was considered the proper outcome of combat. During the Imperial era, matches were sometimes advertised \"sine missione\" (without remission from the sentence of death), which suggests that \"missio\" (the sparing of a defeated gladiator's life) had become a common practice at the games. The contract between \"editor\" and \"lanista\" could include compensation for unexpected deaths. As the demand for gladiators began to exceed supply, matches \"sine missione\" were officially banned, a pragmatic Augustan decision that also happened to reflect popular demands for \"natural justice\". Refusals by Caligula and Claudius to spare popular but defeated fighters did nothing to boost their own popularity. In most circumstances, a gladiator who fought well was likely to be spared.\n\nAmong the cognoscenti, bravado and skill in combat were esteemed over mere bloodshed; some gladiators made their careers and reputation from bloodless victories. Suetonius describes an exceptional \"munus\" by Nero, in which no-one was killed, \"not even \"noxii\" (enemies of the state).\"\n\nBy common custom, the spectators decided whether or not a losing gladiator should be spared, and chose the winner in the rare event of a \"standing tie\". Most matches employed a senior referee (\"summa rudis\") and an assistant, shown in mosaics with long staffs (\"rudes\") to caution or separate opponents at some crucial point in the match. A gladiator's self-acknowledged defeat, signaled by a raised finger (\"ad digitum\"), told the referee to stop the combat and refer to the \"editor\", whose decision would usually rest on the crowd's mood. During the match, referees exercised judgement and discretion; they could stop bouts entirely, or pause them to allow combatants rest, refreshment and a \"rub-down\".\n\nMost gladiators fought at two or three munera annually. An unknown number died in their first match and a few fought in up to 150 combats. At a Pompeian match between chariot-fighters, Publius Ostorius, with previous 51 wins to his credit, was granted missio after losing to Scylax, with 26 victories. A single bout probably lasted between 10â15 minutes, or 20 minutes at most; Spectators preferred well matched \"ordinarii\" with complementary fighting styles but other combinations are found, such as several gladiators fighting together or the serial replacement of a match loser by a new gladiator, who would fight the winner.\n\nVictors received the palm branch and an award from the \"editor\". An outstanding fighter might receive a laurel crown and money from an appreciative crowd but for anyone originally condemned \"ad ludum\" the greatest reward was manumission (i.e., emancipation), symbolised by the gift of a wooden training sword or staff (\"rudis\") from the \"editor\". Martial describes a match between Priscus and Verus, who fought so evenly and bravely for so long that when both acknowledged defeat at the same instant, Titus awarded victory and a \"rudis\" to each. Flamma was awarded the \"rudis\" four times, but chose to remain a gladiator. His gravestone in Sicily includes his record: \"Flamma, \"secutor\", lived 30 years, fought 34 times, won 21 times, fought to a draw 9 times, defeated 4 times, a Syrian by nationality. Delicatus made this for his deserving comrade-in-arms.\"\n\nPopular factions supported favourite gladiators and gladiator types. Under Augustan legislation, the Samnite type was renamed \"secutor\" (equipped with an oblong or \"large\" shield called a \"scutum\"), whose supporters were \"secutarii\". As the games evolved, any lightly armed, defensive fighter could be included in this group. The heavily armoured and armed Thracian types (\"Thraex\") and Murmillo, who fought with smaller shields called a \"parma\", were \"parmularii\" (small shield), as were their supporters. Trajan preferred the \"parmularii\" and Domitian the \"secutarii\"; Marcus Aurelius took neither side. Nero seems to have enjoyed the brawls between rowdy, enthusiastic and sometimes violent factions, but called in the troops if they went too far.\nOnce a band of five \"retiarii\" in tunics, matched against the same number of \"secutores\", yielded without a struggle; but when their death was ordered, one of them caught up his trident and slew all the victors. Caligula bewailed this in a public proclamation as a most cruel murder.\nThere were also local rivalries. At Pompeii's amphitheatre, trading of insults between Pompeians and Nucerian spectators during public \"ludi\" led to stone throwing and riot. Many were killed or wounded. Nero banned gladiator \"munera\" (though not the games) at Pompeii for ten years as punishment. The story is told in graffiti and high quality wall painting, with much boasting of Pompeii's \"victory\" over Nuceria.\n\nThe earliest named gladiator school (singular: \"ludus\"; plural: \"ludi\") is that of Aurelius Scaurus at CapuaÂ â he was \"lanista\" of the gladiators employed by the state circa 105 BC to instruct the legions and simultaneously entertain the public. Few other \"lanistae\" are known by name: they were head of their \"familia gladiatoria\", with legal power over life and death of every family member, including \"servi poenae\", \"auctorati\" and ancillaries but socially they were \"infames\", on a footing with pimps and butchers and despised as price gougers. No such stigma was attached to a gladiator owner (\"munerarius\" or \"editor\") of good family, high status and independent means; Cicero congratulated his friend Atticus on buying a splendid troopÂ â if he rented them out, he might recover their entire cost after two performances.\n\nThe Spartacus revolt had originated in a gladiator school privately owned by Lentulus Batiatus, and had been suppressed only after a protracted series of costly, sometimes disastrous campaigns by regular Roman troops. In the late Republican era, a fear of similar uprisings, the usefulness of gladiator schools in creating private armies, and the exploitation of \"munera\" for political gain led to increased restrictions on gladiator school ownership, siting and organisation. By Domitian's time, many had been more or less absorbed by the State, including those at Pergamum, Alexandria, Praeneste and Capua. The city of Rome itself had four; the \"Ludus Magnus\" (the largest and most important, housing up to about 2,000 gladiators), \"Ludus Dacicus\", \"Ludus Gallicus\", and the \"Ludus Matutinus\", which trained \"bestiarii\".\n\nIn the Imperial era, volunteers required a magistrate's permission to join a school as \"auctorati\". If this was granted, the school's physician assessed their suitability. Their contract (\"auctoramentum\") stipulated how often they were to perform, their fighting style and earnings. A condemned bankrupt or debtor accepted as novice (\"novicius\") could negotiate with his \"lanista\" or \"editor\" for the partial or complete payment of his debt. Faced with runaway re-enlistment fees for skilled \"auctorati\", Marcus Aurelius set their upper limit at 12,000 \"sesterces\".\n\nAll prospective gladiators, whether volunteer or condemned, were bound to service by a sacred oath (\"sacramentum\"). Novices (\"novicii\") trained under teachers of particular fighting styles, probably retired gladiators. They could ascend through a hierarchy of grades (singular: \"palus\") in which \"primus palus\" was the highest. Lethal weapons were prohibited in the schoolsÂ â weighted, blunt wooden versions were probably used. Fighting styles were probably learned through constant rehearsal as choreographed \"numbers\". An elegant, economical style was preferred. Training included preparation for a stoical, unflinching death. Successful training required intense commitment.\n\nThose condemned \"ad ludum\" were probably branded or marked with a tattoo (\"stigma\", plural \"stigmata\") on the face, legs and/or hands. These \"stigmata\" may have been textÂ â fugitive slaves were marked thus on the forehead until Constantine banned the use of facial stigmata in 325 AD. Soldiers were marked on the hand.\n\nGladiators were typically accommodated in cells, arranged in barrack formation around a central practice arena. Juvenal describes the segregation of gladiators according to type and status, suggestive of rigid hierarchies within the schools: \"even the lowest scum of the arena observe this rule; even in prison they're separate\". \"Retiarii\" were kept away from \"damnati\", and \"fag targeteers\" from \"armoured heavies\". As most \"ordinarii\" at games were from the same school, this kept potential opponents separate and safe from each other until the lawful \"munus\". Discipline could be extreme, even lethal. Remains of a Pompeian \"ludus\" site attest to developments in supply, demand and discipline; in its earliest phase, the building could accommodate 15â20 gladiators. Its replacement could have housed about 100 and included a very small cell, probably for lesser punishments and so low that standing was impossible.\n\nDespite the harsh discipline, gladiators represented a substantial investment for their \"lanista\" and were otherwise well fed and cared for. Their daily, high-energy, vegetarian diet consisted of barley, boiled beans, oatmeal, ash (believed to help fortify the body) and dried fruit. Compared to modern athletes, they were probably overweight, but this may have \"protected their vital organs from the cutting blows of their opponents\". The same research suggests they may have fought barefoot.\n\nRegular massage and high quality medical care helped mitigate an otherwise very severe training regimen. Part of Galen's medical training was at a gladiator school in Pergamum where he saw (and would later criticise) the training, diet, and long term health prospects of the gladiators.\n\n\"He vows to endure to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten, and to be killed by the sword.\" \"The gladiator's oath as cited by Petronius (Satyricon, 117).\"\nModern customs and institutions offer few useful parallels to the legal and social context of the \"gladiatoria munera\" In Roman law, anyone condemned to the arena or the gladiator schools (\"damnati ad ludum\") was a \"servus poenae\" (slave of the penalty), and was considered to be under sentence of death unless manumitted. A rescript of Hadrian reminded magistrates that \"those sentenced to the sword\" should be despatched immediately \"or at least within the year\". Those sentenced to the \"ludi\" should not be discharged before five years or three years if awarded manumission. On the one hand, only slaves found guilty of specific offences could be sentenced to the arena, and citizens were legally exempt from this sentence. On the other hand, citizens found guilty of particular offenses could be stripped of citizenship, formally enslaved and sentenced as slaves; and freedmen or freedwomen offenders could be legally reverted to slavery. Arena punishment could be meted for banditry, theft and arson, or treasonous acts such as rebellion, census evasion to avoid paying due taxes and refusal to swear lawful oaths.\n\nOffenders seen as particularly obnoxious to the state (\"noxii\") received the most humiliating punishments. By the 1st century BC, \"noxii\" were being condemned to the beasts (\"damnati ad bestias\") in the arena, with almost no chance of survival, or were made to kill each other. From the early Imperial era, some were forced to participate in humiliating and novel forms of mythological or historical enactment, culminating in their execution.\nThose judged less harshly might be condemned \"ad ludum venatorium\" or \"ad gladiatorium\"Â â combat with animals or gladiatorsÂ â and armed as thought appropriate. These \"damnati\" at least might put on a good show and retrieve some respect. They might evenÂ â and occasionally didÂ â survive to fight another day. Some may even have become \"proper\" gladiators.\n\nThe phenomenon of the \"volunteer\" gladiator is more problematic. All contracted volunteers, including those of equestrian and senatorial class, were legally enslaved by their \"auctoratio\" because it involved their potentially lethal submission to a master. Nor does the citizen or free volunteer's \"professional\" status translate into modern terms. All \"arenarii\" (those who appeared in the arena) were \"\"infames\" by reputation\", a form of social dishonour which excluded them from most of the advantages and rights of citizenship. Payment for such appearances compounded their \"infamia\". The legal and social status of even the most popular and wealthy \"auctorati\" was thus marginal at best. They could not vote, plead in court nor leave a will; unless they were manumitted, their lives and property belonged to their masters. Nevertheless, there is evidence of informal if not entirely lawful practices to the contrary. Some \"unfree\" gladiators bequeathed money and personal property to wives and children, possibly via a sympathetic owner or \"familia\"; some had their own slaves and gave them their freedom. One gladiator was even granted \"citizenship\" to several Greek cities of the Eastern Roman world.\n\nAmong the most admired and skilled \"auctorati\" were those who, having been granted manumission, volunteered to fight in the arena. Some of these highly trained and experienced specialists may have had no other practical choice open to them. Their legal status â slave or free â is uncertain. Under Roman law, a former gladiator could not \"offer such services [as those of a gladiator] after manumission, because they cannot be performed without endangering [his] life.\"\n\nCaesar's \"munus\" of 46 BC included at least one equestrian, son of a Praetor, and possibly two senatorial volunteers. Under Augustus, senators and equestrians and their descendants were formally excluded from the \"infamia\" of association with the arena and its personnel \"(arenarii)\". However, some magistratesÂ â and some later EmperorsÂ â tacitly or openly condoned such transgressions and some volunteers were prepared to embrace the resulting loss of status. Some did so for payment, some for military glory and, in one recorded case, for personal honour. In 11 AD, Augustus, who enjoyed the games, bent his own rules and allowed equestrians to volunteer because \"the prohibition was no use\". Under Tiberius, the Larinum decree (19AD) reiterated the laws which Augustus himself had waived. Thereafter, Caligula flouted them and Claudius strengthened them. Nero and Commodus ignored them. Valentinian II, some hundreds of years later, protested against the same infractions and repeated similar laws: his was an officially Christian empire.\n\nOne very notable social renegade was an aristocratic descendant of the Gracchi, infamous for his marriage (as a bride) to a male horn player. He made a voluntary and \"shameless\" arena appearance not only as a lowly \"retiarius tunicatus\" but in woman's attire and a conical hat adorned with gold ribbon. In Juvenal's account, he seems to have relished the scandalous self-display, applause and the disgrace he inflicted on his more sturdy opponent by repeatedly skipping away from the confrontation.\n\nAs \"munera\" grew larger and more popular, open spaces such as the Forum Romanum were adapted (as the Forum Boarium had been) as venues in Rome and elsewhere, with temporary, elevated seating for the patron and high status spectators; they were popular but not truly public events:\n\nA show of gladiators was to be exhibited before the people in the market-place, and most of the magistrates erected scaffolds round about, with an intention of letting them for advantage. Caius commanded them to take down their scaffolds, that the poor people might see the sport without paying anything. But nobody obeying these orders of his, he gathered together a body of labourers, who worked for him, and overthrew all the scaffolds the very night before the contest was to take place. So that by the next morning the market-place was cleared, and the common people had an opportunity of seeing the pastime. In this, the populace thought he had acted the part of a man; but he much disobliged the tribunes his colleagues, who regarded it as a piece of violent and presumptuous interference.\n\nTowards the end of the Republic, Cicero (\"Murena\", 72â3) still describes gladiator shows as ticketedÂ â their political usefulness was served by inviting the rural tribunes of the plebs, not the people of Rome \"en masse\" â but in Imperial times, poor citizens in receipt of the corn dole were allocated at least some free seating, possibly by lottery. Others had to pay. Ticket scalpers (\"Locarii\") sometimes sold or let out seats at inflated prices. Martial wrote that \"Hermes [a gladiator who always drew the crowds] means riches for the ticket scalpers\".\n\nThe earliest known Roman amphitheatre was built at Pompeii by Sullan colonists, around 70 BC. The first in the city of Rome was the extraordinary wooden amphitheatre of Gaius Scribonius Curio (built in 53 BC). The first part-stone amphitheatre in Rome inaugurated in 29â30 BC, in time for the triple triumph of Octavian (later Augustus). Shortly after it burned down in 64 AD, Vespasian began its replacement, later known as the Amphitheatrum Flavium (Colosseum), which seated 50,000 spectators and would remain the largest in the Empire. It was inaugurated by Titus in 80 AD the personal gift of the Emperor to the people of Rome, paid for by the Imperial share of booty after the Jewish Revolt.\n\nAmphitheatres were usually oval in plan. Their seating tiers surrounded the arena below, where the community's judgments were meted out, in full view of all. From across the stands, crowd and \"editor\" could assess each other's character and temperament. For the crowd, amphitheatres afforded unique opportunities for free expression and free speech (\"theatralis licentia\"). Petitions could be submitted to the \"editor\" (as magistrate) in full view of the community. \"Factiones\" and claques could vent their spleen on each other, and occasionally on Emperors. The emperor Titus's dignified yet confident ease in his management of an amphitheatre crowd and its factions were taken as a measure of his enormous popularity and the rightness of his imperium. The amphitheatre \"munus\" thus served the Roman community as living theatre and a court in miniature, in which judgement could be served not only on those in the arena below, but on their judges. Amphitheatres also provided a means of social control. Their seating was \"disorderly and indiscriminate\" until Augustus prescribed its arrangement in his Social Reforms. To persuade the Senate, he expressed his distress on behalf of a Senator who could not find seating at a crowded games in Puteoli:\nIn consequence of this the senate decreed that, whenever any public show was given anywhere, the first row of seats should be reserved for senators; and at Rome he would not allow the envoys of the free and allied nations to sit in the orchestra, since he was informed that even freedmen were sometimes appointed. He separated the soldiery from the people. He assigned special seats to the married men of the commons, to boys under age their own section and the adjoining one to their preceptors; and he decreed that no one wearing a dark cloak should sit in the middle of the house. He would not allow women to view even the gladiators except from the upper seats, though it had been the custom for men and women to sit together at such shows. Only the Vestal virgins were assigned a place to themselves, opposite the praetor's tribunal.\nThese arrangements do not seem to have been strongly enforced.\n\nThe proximity of death defined the \"munus\" for all concerned. To die well, a gladiator should never ask for mercy, nor cry out. A \"good death\" redeemed a defeated gladiator from the dishonourable weakness and passivity of defeat, and provided a noble example to those who watched:\nFor death, when it stands near us, gives even to inexperienced men the courage not to seek to avoid the inevitable. So the gladiator, no matter how faint-hearted he has been throughout the fight, offers his throat to his opponent and directs the wavering blade to the vital spot. (Seneca. \"Epistles\", 30.8)\n\nSome mosaics show defeated gladiators kneeling in preparation for the moment of death. Seneca's \"vital spot\" seems to have meant the neck. Gladiator remains from Ephesus confirm this.\n\nThe body of a gladiator who had died well was placed on a couch of Libitina and removed from the arena with dignity. Once in the arena morgue, the corpse would have been stripped of armour, and probably had its throat cut to prove that dead was dead. The Christian author Tertullian, commenting on \"ludi meridiani\" in Roman Carthage during the peak era of the games, describes a more humiliating method of removal. One arena official, dressed as the \"brother of Jove\", Dis Pater (god of the underworld) strikes the corpse with a mallet. Another, dressed as Mercury, tests for life-signs with a heated \"wand\"; once confirmed as dead, the body is dragged from the arena. Whether these victims were gladiators or \"noxii\" is unknown. Modern pathological examination confirms the probably fatal use of a mallet on some, but not all the gladiator skulls found in a gladiators' cemetery. Kyle (1998) proposes that gladiators who disgraced themselves might have been subjected to the same indignities as \"noxii\", denied the relative mercies of a quick death and dragged from the arena as carrion. Whether the corpse of such a gladiator could be redeemed from further ignominy by friends or \"familia\" is not known.\n\nThe average gladiator lifespan was short; few survived more than 10 matches or lived past the age of 30. One (Felix) is known to have lived to 45 and one retired gladiator lived to 90. George Ville calculated an average age at death at 27 for gladiators (based on headstone evidence), with mortality \"among all who entered the arena\" around the 1st century AD at 19/100. A rise in the risk of death for losers, from 1/5 to 1/4 between the early and later Imperial periods, seems to suggest \"missio\" was granted less often. Marcus Junkelmann disputes Ville's calculation for average age at death; the majority would have received no headstone, and would have died early in their careers, at 18â25 years of age. Historians Keith Hopkins and Mary Beard tentatively estimate a total of 400 arenas throughout the Roman Empire at its greatest extent, with a combined total of 8,000 deaths per annum from all causes, including execution, combat and accident.\n\nDeath and disposal therefore perpetuated the divisions and judgements of society. In the pre-Christian era, the highest status funerals involved expensive, prolonged cremation ceremonies, sometimes complete with a \"munus\" offering. At the opposite extreme, the \"noxii\" (and possibly other \"damnati\") could be thrown into rivers or dumped unburied. This extended their \"damnatio\" beyond death into perpetual oblivion and their shade (\"manes\") to restless wandering upon the earth as dreadful \"larvae\" or \"lemures\". All othersÂ â citizens, slaves or freeÂ â were usually buried beyond the town or city limits to avoid the ritual and physical pollution of their community. Gladiators were segregated in separate cemeteries. Even for those whose death had brought honourable release, the taint of \"infamia\" was perpetual.\n\nMemorials were a major expense, and testify only to those who prospered. Gladiators could subscribe to a union (\"collegia\") which ensured proper burial, with compensation for wives and children. The gladiator's \"familia\" or one of its members (including \"lanistae\", comrades, wives and children) sometimes paid.\n\nTomb inscriptions from the Eastern Roman Empire include these brief examples:\n\n\"The familia set this up in memory of Saturnilos.\"\n\"For Nikepharos, son of Synetos, Lakedaimonian, and for Narcissus the secutor. Titus Flavius Satyrus set up this monument in his memory from his own money.\"\n\"For Hermes. Paitraeites with his cell-mates set this up in memory\".\nVery little evidence survives for the religious beliefs of gladiators as a class, or their expectations of an afterlife. Modern scholarship offers little support for the once-prevalent notion that gladiators, along with \"venatores\" and \"bestiarii\" were personally or professionally dedicated to the cult of Nemesis. Rather, she seems to have been associated with Imperial power, and thus with the arena as a place of Imperial justice and retribution. One gladiator's tomb dedication clearly states that her decisions are not to be trusted. Nevertheless, the hand of Nemesis in a gladiator's death absolved him from ignominy. His \"virtus\" could thus be remembered in perpetuity, and he could be memorialised as a skilled fighter, one worth avenging:\n\n\"I, Victor, left-handed, lie here, but my homeland was in Thessalonica. Doom killed me, not the liar Pinnas. No longer let him boast. I had a fellow gladiator, Polyneikes, who killed Pinnas and avenged me. Claudius Thallus set up this memorial from what I left behind as a legacy.\"\n\nA man who knows how to conquer in war is a man who knows how to arrange a banquet and put on a show.\nRome was essentially a landowning military aristocracy. From the early days of the Republic, ten years of military service were a citizen's duty and a prerequisite for election to public office. \"Devotio\" (willingness to sacrifice oneâs life to the greater good) was central to the Roman military ideal, and was the core of the Roman military oath. It applied from highest to lowest alike in the chain of command. As a soldier committed his life (voluntarily, at least in theory) to the greater cause of Rome's victory, he was not expected to survive defeat.\n\nThe Punic Wars of the late 3rd century BCÂ â in particular the near-catastrophic defeat of Roman arms at CannaeÂ â had long-lasting effects on the Republic, its citizen armies, and the development of the gladiatorial \"munera\". In the aftermath of Cannae, Scipio Africanus crucified Roman deserters and had non-Roman deserters thrown to the beasts. The Senate refused to ransom Hannibal's Roman captives: instead, they consulted the Sibylline books, then made drastic preparations:\nIn obedience to the Books of Destiny, some strange and unusual sacrifices were made, human sacrifices amongst them. A Gaulish man and a Gaulish woman and a Greek man and a Greek woman were buried alive under the Forum BoariumÂ ... They were lowered into a stone vault, which had on a previous occasion also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings. When the gods were believed to be duly propitiatedÂ ... Armour, weapons, and other things of the kind were ordered to be in readiness, and the ancient spoils gathered from the enemy were taken down from the temples and colonnades. The dearth of freemen necessitated a new kind of enlistment; 8,000 sturdy youths from amongst the slaves were armed at the public cost, after they had each been asked whether they were willing to serve or no. These soldiers were preferred, as there would be an opportunity of ransoming them when taken prisoners at a lower price.\nThe account notes, uncomfortably, the proximity of recent human sacrifice. While the Senate mustered their willing slaves, Hannibal offered his dishonoured Roman captives a chance for honourable death, in what Livy describes as something very like the Roman \"munus\". The \"munus\" thus represented an essentially military, self-sacrificial ideal, taken to extreme fulfillment in the gladiator's oath. By the \"devotio\" of a voluntary oath, a slave might achieve the quality of a Roman (\"Romanitas\"), become the embodiment of true \"virtus\" (manliness, or manly virtue), and paradoxically, be granted \"missio\" while remaining a slave. The gladiator as a specialist fighter, and the ethos and organization of the gladiator schools, would inform the development of the Roman military as the most effective force of its time. In 107 BC, the Marian Reforms established the Roman army as a professional body. Two years later, following its defeat at Arausio:\n...weapons training was given to soldiers by P. Rutilius, consul with C. Mallis. For he, following the example of no previous general, with teachers summoned from the gladiatorial training school of C. Aurelus Scaurus, implanted in the legions a more sophisticated method of avoiding and dealing a blow and mixed bravery with skill and skill back again with virtue so that skill became stronger by bravery's passion and passion became more wary with the knowledge of this art.\nThe military were great aficionados of the games, and supervised the schools. Many schools and amphitheatres were sited at or near military barracks, and some provincial army units owned gladiator troupes. As the Republic wore on, the term of military service increased from ten to the sixteen years formalised by Augustus in the Principate. It would rise to twenty, and later, to twenty five years. Roman military discipline was ferocious; severe enough to provoke mutiny, despite the consequences. A career as a volunteer gladiator may have seemed an attractive option for some.\n\nIn the Year of the Four Emperors, Otho's troops at Bedriacum included 2000 gladiators. Opposite him on the field, Vitellius's army was swollen by levies of slaves, plebs and gladiators. In 167 AD, troop depletions by plague and desertion may have prompted Marcus Aurelius to draft gladiators at his own expense. During the Civil Wars that led to the Principate, Octavian (later Augustus) acquired the personal gladiator troop of his erstwhile opponent, Mark Antony. They had served their late master with exemplary loyalty but thereafter, they disappear from the record.\n\nRoman writing as a whole demonstrates a deep ambivalence towards the \"gladiatoria munera\". Even the most complex and sophisticated \"munera\" of the Imperial era evoked the ancient, ancestral \"dii manes\" of the underworld and were framed by the protective, lawful rites of \"sacrificium\". Their popularity made their co-option by the state inevitable; Cicero acknowledged their sponsorship as a political imperative. Despite the popular adulation of gladiators, they were set apart, despised; and despite Cicero's contempt for the mob, he shared their admiration: \"Even when [gladiators] have been felled, let alone when they are standing and fighting, they never disgrace themselves. And suppose a gladiator has been brought to the ground, when do you ever see one twist his neck away after he has been ordered to extend it for the death blow?\" His own death would later emulate this example. Yet, Cicero could also refer to his popularist opponent Clodius, publicly and scathingly, as a \"bustuarius\"Â â literally, a \"funeral-man\", implying that Clodius has shown the moral temperament of the lowest sort of gladiator. Such finer distinctions aside, \"gladiator\" could be (and was) used as an insult throughout the Roman period. Silius Italicus wrote, as the games approached their peak, that the degenerate Campanians had devised the very worst of precedents, which now threatened the moral fabric of Rome: \"It was their custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men fighting; often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revelers, and the tables were stained with streams of blood. Thus demoralised was Capua.\" Death might be rightly meted out as punishment, or met with equanimity in peace or war as a gift of fate, but if it was inflicted as a form of secular entertainment, with no underlying moral or religious purpose, it could only pollute and demean those who witnessed it.\n\nThe \"munus\" itself could be interpreted as pious necessity, but its increasing luxury corroded Roman virtue, and created an un-Roman appetite for profligacy and self-indulgence. Caesar's 46 BC \"ludi\" were hardly justified as \"munus\" after a 20-year interval since his father's death, in which case they were mere entertainment for political gain, a waste of lives, and of money, better doled out to needy army veterans. Yet for Seneca, and for Marcus AureliusÂ â both professed StoicsÂ â the degradation of gladiators in the \"munus\" highlighted their Stoic virtues: their unconditional obedience to their master and to fate, and equanimity in the face of death. Having \"neither hope nor illusions\", the gladiator could transcend his own debased nature, and disempower death itself by meeting it face to face. Courage, dignity, altruism and loyalty were morally redemptive; Lucian idealised this principle in his story of Sisinnes, who voluntarily fought as a gladiator, earned 10,000 drachmas and used it to buy freedom for his friend, Toxaris. Seneca had a lower opinion of the mob's un-Stoical appetite for \"ludi meridiani\": \"Man [is]...now slaughtered for jest and sport; and those whom it used to be unholy to train for the purpose of inflicting and enduring wounds are thrust forth exposed and defenceless.\"\n\nThese accounts seek a higher moral meaning from the \"munus\", but Ovid's very detailed (though satirical) instructions for seduction in the amphitheatre suggest that the spectacles could generate a potent and dangerously sexual atmosphere. Augustan seating prescriptions placed womenÂ â excepting the Vestals, who were legally inviolateÂ â as far as possible from the action of the arena floor; or tried to. There remained the thrilling possibility of clandestine sexual transgression by high-caste spectators and their heroes of the arena. Such assignations were a source for gossip and satire but some became unforgivably public:\nWhat was the youthful charm that so fired Eppia? What hooked her? What did she see in him to make her put up with being called \"the gladiator's moll\"? Her poppet, her Sergius, was no chicken, with a dud arm that prompted hope of early retirement. Besides his face looked a proper mess, helmet-scarred, a great wart on his nose, an unpleasant discharge always trickling from one eye. But he was a gladiator. That word makes the whole breed seem handsome, and made her prefer him to her children and country, her sister, her husband. Steel is what they fall in love with.\nEppiaÂ â a senator's wifeÂ â and her Sergius eloped to Egypt, where he deserted her. Most gladiators would have aimed lower. Two wall \"graffiti\" in Pompeii describe Celadus the Thraex as \"the sigh of the girls\" and \"the glory of the girls\"Â â which may or may not have been Celadus' own wishful thinking.\n\nIn the later Imperial era, Servius Maurus Honoratus uses the same disparaging term as CiceroÂ â \"bustuarius\"Â â for gladiators. Tertullian used it somewhat differentlyÂ â all victims of the arena were sacrificial in his eyesÂ â and expressed the paradox of the \"arenarii\" as a class, from a Christian viewpoint:\nOn the one and the same account they glorify them and they degrade and diminish them; yes, further, they openly condemn them to disgrace and civil degradation; they keep them religiously excluded from council chamber, rostrum, senate, knighthood, and every other kind of office and a good many distinctions. The perversity of it! They love whom they lower; they despise whom they approve; the art they glorify, the artist they disgrace.\n\nIn this new Play, I attempted to follow the old custom of mine, of making a fresh trial; I brought it on again. In the first Act I pleased; when in the meantime a rumor spread that gladiators were about to be exhibited; the populace flock together, make a tumult, clamor aloud, and fight for their places: meantime, I was unable to maintain my place.\n\nImages of gladiators could be found throughout the Republic and Empire, among all classes. Walls in the 2nd century BC \"Italian Agora\" at Delos were decorated with paintings of gladiators. Mosaics dating from the 2nd through 4th centuries AD have been invaluable in the reconstruction of combat and its rules, gladiator types and the development of the \"munus\". Throughout the Roman world, ceramics, lamps, gems and jewellery, mosaics, reliefs, wall paintings and statuary offer evidence, sometimes the best evidence, of the clothing, props, equipment, names, events, prevalence and rules of gladiatorial combat. Earlier periods provide only occasional, perhaps exceptional examples. The Gladiator Mosaic in the Galleria Borghese displays several gladiator types, and the Bignor Roman Villa mosaic from Provincial Britain shows Cupids as gladiators. Souvenir ceramics were produced depicting named gladiators in combat; similar images of higher quality, were available on more expensive articles in high quality ceramic, glass or silver.\n\nPliny the Elder gives vivid examples of the popularity of gladiator portraiture in Antium and an artistic treat laid on by an adoptive aristocrat for the solidly plebeian citizens of the Roman Aventine:\nWhen a freedman of Nero was giving a gladiatorial show at Antium, the public porticoes were covered with paintings, so we are told, containing life-like portraits of all the gladiators and assistants. This portraiture of gladiators has been the highest interest in art for many centuries now, but it was Gaius Terentius who began the practice of having pictures made of gladiatorial shows and exhibited in public; in honour of his grandfather who had adopted him he provided thirty pairs of Gladiators in the Forum for three consecutive days, and exhibited a picture of the matches in the Grove of Diana.\n\nSome Roman reenactors attempt to recreate Roman gladiator troupes. Some of these groups are part of larger Roman reenactment groups, and others are wholly independent, though they might participate in larger demonstrations of Roman reenacting or historical reenacting in general. These groups usually focus on portraying mock gladiatorial combat in as accurate a manner as possible.\n\nGladiator fights have been depicted in a number of peplum films (also known as \"sword-and-sandal\" movies). This is a genre of largely Italian-made historical epics (costume dramas) that dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965. They can be immediately differentiated from the competing Hollywood product by their use of dubbing. The pepla attempted to emulate the big-budget Hollywood historical epics of the time, such as \"Spartacus\". Inspired by the success of \"Spartacus\", there were a number of Italian peplums that emphasized the gladiatorial arena fights in their plots, with it becoming almost a peplum subgenre in itself; One group of supermen known as \"The Ten Gladiators\" appeared in a trilogy, all three films starring Dan Vadis in the lead role.\n\n\n\"The Arena\" (also known as the \"Naked Warriors\") is a 1974 gladiator exploitation film, starring Margaret Markov and Pam Grier, and directed by Steve Carver and an uncredited Joe D'Amato. Grier and Markov portray female gladiators in ancient Rome, who have been enslaved and must fight for their freedom. \"Gladiator\" is a 2000 British-American epic historical drama film directed by Ridley Scott, and starring Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Crowe portrays a fictional Roman general who is reduced to slavery and then rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murder of his family. \"Amazons and Gladiators\" is a 2001 drama action adventure film directed and written by Zachary Weintraub starring Patrick Bergin and Jennifer Rubin. \"Cyclops\" is a 2008 television monster film about the mythological cyclops, the last survivor of his species. After fighting the Roman Army, he ends up captured and enslaved as a gladiator/beast in Emperor Tiberius' Circus Maximus, and used for gladiator combats. American actor Eric Roberts plays Emperor Tiberius.\n\n\n", "id": "12336", "title": "Gladiator"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12339", "text": "Genetically modified organism\n\nA genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques (i.e., a genetically \"engineered\" organism). GMOs are used to produce many medications and genetically modified foods and are widely used in scientific research and the production of other goods. The term GMO is very close to the technical legal term, 'living modified organism', defined in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which regulates international trade in living GMOs (specifically, \"any living organism that possesses a novel combination of genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology\").\n\nA more specifically defined type of GMO is a \"transgenic organism.\" This is an organism whose genetic makeup has been altered by the addition of genetic material from an unrelated organism. This should not be confused with the more general way in which \"GMO\" is used to classify genetically altered organisms, as typically GMOs are organisms whose genetic makeup has been altered without the addition of genetic material from an unrelated organism.\n\nThe first genetically modified mouse was created in 1974, and the first plant was produced in 1983.\nGenetic modification involves the mutation, insertion, or deletion of genes. Inserted genes usually come from a different species in a form of horizontal gene-transfer. In nature this can occur when exogenous DNA penetrates the cell membrane for any reason. This can be accomplished artificially by:\n\n\nOther methods exploit natural forms of gene transfer, such as the ability of \"Agrobacterium\" to transfer genetic material to plants,\nor the ability of lentiviruses to transfer genes to animal cells.\n\nHumans have domesticated plants and animals since around 12,000 BCE, using selective breeding or artificial selection (as contrasted with natural selection). The process of selective breeding, in which organisms with desired traits (and thus with the desired genes) are used to breed the next generation and organisms lacking the trait are not bred, is a precursor to the modern concept of genetic modification. Various advancements in genetics allowed humans to directly alter the DNA and therefore genes of organisms. In 1972 Paul Berg created the first recombinant DNA molecule when he combined DNA from a monkey virus with that of the lambda virus.\n\nHerbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen made the first genetically modified organism (GMO) in 1973. They took a gene from a bacterium that provided resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin, inserted it into a plasmid and then induced another bacteria to uptake the plasmid. The bacteria was then able to survive in the presence of kanamycin. Boyer and Cohen expressed other genes in bacteria. This included genes from the toad Xenopus laevis in 1974, creating the first GMO expressing a gene from an organism from different kingdom.\nIn 1974 Rudolf Jaenisch created a transgenic mouse by introducing foreign DNA into its embryo, making it the worldâs first transgenic animal. However it took another eight years before transgenic mice were developed that passed the transgene to their offspring. Genetically modified mice were created in 1984 that carried cloned oncogenes, predisposed them to developing cancer. Mice with genes knocked out (knockout mouse) were created in 1989. The first transgenic livestock were produced in 1985 and the first animal to synthesise transgenic proteins in their milk were mice, engineered to produce human tissue plasminogen activator in 1987.\n\nIn 1983 the first genetically engineered plant was developed by Michael W. Bevan, Richard B. Flavell and Mary-Dell Chilton. They infected tobacco with \"Agrobacterium\" transformed with an antibiotic resistance gene and through tissue culture techniques were able to grow a new plant containing the resistance gene. The gene gun was invented in 1987, allowing transformation of plants not susceptible to \"Agrobacterium\" infection. In 2000, Vitamin A-enriched golden rice, was the first plant developed with increased nutrient value.\n\nIn 1976 Genentech, the first genetic engineering company was founded by Herbert Boyer and Robert Swanson; a year later, the company produced a human protein (somatostatin) in \"E.coli\". Genentech announced the production of genetically engineered human insulin in 1978. The insulin produced by bacteria, branded humulin, was approved for release by the Food and Drug Administration in 1982. In 1988 the first human antibodies were produced in plants. In 1987, the ice-minus strain of \"P. syringae\" became the first genetically modified organism to be released into the environment when a strawberry field and a potato field in California were sprayed with it.\n\nThe first genetically modified crop, an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant, was produced in 1982. China was the first country to commercialize transgenic plants, introducing a virus-resistant tobacco in 1992. In 1994 Calgene attained approval to commercially release the Flavr Savr tomato, the first genetically modified food. Also in 1994, the European Union approved tobacco engineered to be resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil, making it the first genetically engineered crop commercialized in Europe. An insect resistant Potato was approved for release in the USA in 1995, and by 1996 approval had been granted to commercially grow 8 transgenic crops and one flower crop (carnation) in 6 countries plus the EU.\n\nIn 2010, scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute, announced that they had created the first synthetic bacterial genome. They named it Synthia and it was the world's first synthetic life form.\n\nThe first genetically modified animal to be commercialised was the GloFish, a Zebra fish with a fluorescent gene added that allows it to glow in the dark under ultraviolet light. The first genetically modified animal to be approved for food use was AquAdvantage salmon in 2015. The salmon were transformed with a growth hormone-regulating gene from a Pacific Chinook salmon and a promoter from an ocean pout enabling it to grow year-round instead of only during spring and summer.\n\nGMOs are used in biological and medical research, production of pharmaceutical drugs, experimental medicine (e.g. gene therapy and vaccines against the Ebola virus), and agriculture (e.g. golden rice, resistance to herbicides), with developing uses in conservation. The term \"genetically modified organism\" does not always imply, but can include, targeted insertions of genes from one species into another. For example, a gene from a jellyfish, encoding a fluorescent protein called GFP, or green fluorescent protein, can be physically linked and thus co-expressed with mammalian genes to identify the location of the protein encoded by the GFP-tagged gene in the mammalian cell. Such methods are useful tools for biologists in many areas of research, including those who study the mechanisms of human and other diseases or fundamental biological processes in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells.\n\nBacteria were the first organisms to be modified in the laboratory, due to the relative ease of modifying their genetics.\n\nThey continue to be important model organisms for experiments in genetic engineering. In the field of synthetic biology, they have been used to test various synthetic approaches, from synthesizing genomes to creating novel nucleotides.\n\nThese organisms are now used for several purposes, and are particularly important in producing large amounts of pure human proteins for use in medicine.\n\nGenetically modified bacteria are used to produce the protein insulin to treat diabetes. Similar bacteria have been used to produce biofuels, clotting factors to treat haemophilia, and human growth hormone to treat various forms of dwarfism.\n\nIn addition, various genetically engineered micro-organisms are routinely used as sources of enzymes for the manufacture of a variety of processed foods. These include alpha-amylase from bacteria, which converts starch to simple sugars, chymosin from bacteria or fungi, which clots milk protein for cheese making, and pectinesterase from fungi, which improves fruit juice clarity.\n\nTransgenic plants have been engineered for scientific research, to create new colours in plants, and to create different crops.\n\nIn research, plants are engineered to help discover the functions of certain genes. One way to do this is to knock out the gene of interest and see what phenotype develops. Another strategy is to attach the gene to a strong promoter and see what happens when it is over expressed. A common technique used to find out where the gene is expressed is to attach it to GUS or a similar reporter gene that allows visualisation of the location.'\nAfter thirteen years of collaborative research, an Australian company â Florigene, and a Japanese company â Suntory, created a blue rose (actually lavender or mauve) in 2004. The genetic engineering involved three alterations â adding two genes, and interfering with another. One of the added genes was for the blue plant pigment delphinidin cloned from the pansy. The researchers then used RNA interference (RNAi) technology to depress all color production by endogenous genes by blocking a crucial protein in color production, called dihydroflavonol 4-reductase) (DFR), and adding a variant of that protein that would not be blocked by the RNAi but that would allow the delphinidin to work. The roses are sold in Japan, the United States, and Canada. Florigene has also created and sells lavender-colored carnations that are genetically engineered in a similar way.\n\nSimple plants and plant cells have been genetically engineered for production of biopharmaceuticals in bioreactors as opposed to cultivating plants in open fields. Work has been done with duckweed \"Lemna minor\", the algae \"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\" and the moss \"Physcomitrella patens\".\nAn Israeli company, Protalix, has developed a method to produce therapeutics in cultured transgenic carrot and tobacco cells. Protalix and its partner, Pfizer, received FDA approval to market its drug Elelyso, a treatment for Gaucher's disease, in 2012.\n\nGenetically modified crops (GM crops, or biotech crops) are plants used in agriculture, the DNA of which has been modified using genetic engineering techniques. In most cases the aim is to introduce a new trait to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species. Examples in food crops include resistance to certain pests, diseases, or environmental conditions, reduction of spoilage, or resistance to chemical treatments (e.g. resistance to a herbicide), or improving the nutrient profile of the crop. Examples in non-food crops include production of pharmaceutical agents, biofuels, and other industrially useful goods, as well as for bioremediation.\n\nFarmers have widely adopted GM technology. Between 1996 and 2013, the total surface area of land cultivated with GM crops increased by a factor of 100, from to 1,750,000Â km (432 million acres). 10% of the world's croplands were planted with GM crops in 2010. In the US, by 2014, 94% of the planted area of soybeans, 96% of cotton and 93% of corn were genetically modified varieties. In recent years GM crops expanded rapidly in developing countries. In 2013 approximately 18 million farmers grew 54% of worldwide GM crops in developing countries.\n\nFor discussions of issues about GM crops and GM food, see the Controversies section below and the article on genetically modified food controversies.\n\nCisgenesis, sometimes also called intragenesis, is a product designation for a category of genetically engineered plants. A variety of classification schemes have been proposed that order genetically modified organisms based on the nature of introduced genotypical changes rather than the process of genetic engineering.\n\nWhile some genetically modified plants are developed by the introduction of a gene originating from distant, sexually incompatible species into the host genome, cisgenic plants contain genes that have been isolated either directly from the host species or from sexually compatible species. The new genes are introduced using recombinant DNA methods and gene transfer. Some scientists hope that the approval process of cisgenic plants might be simpler than that of proper transgenics, but it remains to be seen.\n\nGenetically modified organisms have been proposed to aid conservation of plant species threatened by extinction. Many trees face the treat of invasive plants and diseases, such as the emerald ash borer in North American and the fungal disease, Ceratocystis platani, in European plane trees. A suggested solution to increase the resilience of threatened tree species is to genetically modify individuals by transferring resistant genes. Papaya trees are an example of a species that was successfully conserved using genetic modification. The papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) devastated papaya trees in Hawaii in the twentieth century until transgenic papaya plants were given pathogen-derived resistance.\n\nHowever, genetic modification for conservation in plants remains mainly speculative and further experimentation is needed before the technique can be widely implemented. A main concern with using genetic modification for conservation purposes is that a transgenic species may no longer bear enough resemblance to the original species to truly claim that the original species is being conserved. Instead, the transgenic species may be genetically different enough to be considered a new species, thus diminishing the conservation worth of genetic modification.\n\nGenetically modified mammals are an important category of genetically modified organisms. Ralph L. Brinster and Richard Palmiter developed the techniques responsible for transgenic mice, rats, rabbits, sheep, and pigs in the early 1980s, and established many of the first transgenic models of human disease, including the first carcinoma caused by a transgene. The process of genetically engineering animals is a slow, tedious, and expensive process. However, new technologies are making genetic modifications easier and more precise.\n\nThe first transgenic (genetically modified) animal was produced by injecting DNA into mouse embryos then implanting the embryos in female mice.\n\nGenetically modified animals currently being developed can be placed into six different broad classes based on the intended purpose of the genetic modification:\n\nTransgenic animals are used as experimental models to perform phenotypic and for testing in biomedical research.\n\nGenetically modified (genetically engineered) animals are becoming more vital to the discovery and development of cures and treatments for many serious diseases. By altering the DNA or transferring DNA to an animal, we can develop certain proteins that may be used in medical treatment. Stable expressions of human proteins have been developed in many animals, including sheep, pigs, and rats. Human-alpha-1-antitrypsin, which has been tested in sheep and is used in treating humans with this deficiency and transgenic pigs with human-histo-compatibility have been studied in the hopes that the organs will be suitable for transplant with less chances of rejection.\n\nScientists have genetically engineered several organisms, including some mammals, to include green fluorescent protein (GFP), first observed in the jellyfish, \"Aequorea victoria\" in 1962, for medical research purposes (Chalfie, Shimoura, and Tsien were awarded the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 2008 for the discovery and development of GFP ). For example, fluorescent pigs have been bred to study human organ transplants (xenotransplantation), regenerating ocular photoreceptor cells, and other topics. In 2011 a Japanese-American team created green-fluorescent cats to find therapies for HIV/AIDS and other diseases as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is related to HIV.\n\nIn 2009, scientists in Japan announced that they had successfully transferred a gene into a primate species (marmosets) and produced a stable line of breeding transgenic primates for the first time. Their first research target for these marmosets was Parkinson's disease, but they were also considering amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease.\n\nWithin the field known as pharming, intensive research has been conducted to develop transgenic animals that produce biotherapeutics. On 6 February 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first human biological drug produced from such an animal, a goat. The drug, ATryn, is an anticoagulant which reduces the probability of blood clots during surgery or childbirth. It is extracted from the goat's milk.\n\nIn 2006, a pig was engineered to produce omega-3 fatty acids through the expression of a roundworm gene.\n\nEnviropig was a genetically enhanced line of Yorkshire pigs in Canada created with the capability of digesting plant phosphorus more efficiently than conventional Yorkshire pigs. The project ended in 2012. These pigs produced the enzyme phytase, which breaks down the indigestible phosphorus, in their saliva. The enzyme was introduced into the pig chromosome by pronuclear microinjection. With this enzyme, the animal is able to digest cereal grain phosphorus. The use of these pigs would reduce the potential of water pollution since they excrete from 30 to 70.7% less phosphorus in manure depending upon the age and diet. The lower concentrations of phosphorus in surface runoff reduces algal growth, because phosphorus is the limiting nutrient for algae. Because algae consume large amounts of oxygen, it can result in dead zones for fish.\n\nIn 2011, Chinese scientists generated dairy cows genetically engineered with genes from human beings to produce milk that would be the same as human breast milk. This could potentially benefit mothers who cannot produce breast milk but want their children to have breast milk rather than formula. Aside from milk production, the researchers claim these transgenic cows to be identical to regular cows. Two months later scientists from Argentina presented Rosita, a transgenic cow incorporating two human genes, to produce milk with similar properties as human breast milk. In 2012, researchers from New Zealand also developed a genetically engineered cow that produced allergy-free milk.\n\nGoats have been genetically engineered to produce milk with strong spiderweb-like silk proteins in their milk.\n\nGene therapy, uses genetically modified viruses to deliver genes that can cure disease in humans. Although gene therapy is still relatively new, it has had some successes. It has been used to treat genetic disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency, and Leber's congenital amaurosis. Treatments are also being developed for a range of other currently incurable diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Parkinson's disease, cancer, diabetes, heart disease and muscular dystrophy.\n\nGenetically modified organisms have been used to conserve European wild rabbits in the Iberian peninsula and Australia. In both cases, the genetically modified organism used was a myxoma virus, but for opposite purposes: to protect the endangered population in Europe with immunizations and to regulate the overabundant population in Australia with contraceptives.\n\nIn the Iberian peninsula, the European wild rabbit population has experienced a sharp decline from viral diseases and overhunting. To protect the species from viral diseases, the myxoma virus was genetically modified to immunize the rabbits. The European wild rabbit population in Australia faces the opposite problem: lack of natural predators has made the introduced species invasive. The same myxoma virus was genetically modified to lower fertility in the Australian rabbit population.\n\nGenetically modified fish are used for scientific research and as pets, and are being considered for use as food and as aquatic pollution sensors.\n\nGM fish are widely used in basic research in genetics and development. Two species of fish, zebrafish and medaka, are most commonly modified because they have optically clear chorions (membranes in the egg), rapidly develop, and the 1-cell embryo is easy to see and microinject with transgenic DNA.\n\nThe GloFish is a patented brand of genetically modified (GM) fluorescent zebrafish with bright red, green, and orange fluorescent color. Although not originally developed for the ornamental fish trade, it became the first genetically modified animal to become publicly available as a pet when it was introduced for sale in 2003. They were quickly banned for sale in California.\n\nGM fish have been developed with promoters driving an over-production of \"all fish\" growth hormone for use in the aquaculture industry to increase the speed of development and potentially reduce fishing pressure on wild stocks. This has resulted in dramatic growth enhancement in several species, including salmon, trout and tilapia. AquaBounty Technologies, a biotechnology company working on bringing a GM salmon to market, claims that their GM AquAdvantage salmon can mature in half the time as wild salmon. AquaBounty applied for regulatory approval to market their GM salmon in the US, and was approved in November 2015. On 25 November 2013 Canada approved commercial scale production and export of GM Salmon eggs but they are not approved for human consumption in Canada.\n\nSeveral academic groups have been developing GM zebrafish to detect aquatic pollution. The lab that originated the GloFish discussed above originally developed them to change color in the presence of pollutants, to be used as environmental sensors. A lab at University of Cincinnati has been developing GM zebrafish for the same purpose, as has a lab at Tulane University.\n\nRecent research on pain in fish has resulted in concerns being raised that genetic-modifications induced for scientific research may have detrimental effects on the welfare of fish.\n\nGenetically modified frogs are used for scientific research and are widely used in basic research including genetics and early development. Two species of frog, \"Xenopus laevis\" and \"Xenopus tropicalis\", are most commonly used.\n\nGM frogs are also being used as pollution sensors, especially for endocrine disrupting chemicals.\n\nIn biological research, transgenic fruit flies (\"Drosophila melanogaster\") are model organisms used to study the effects of genetic changes on development. Fruit flies are often preferred over other animals due to their short life cycle, low maintenance requirements, and relatively simple genome compared to many vertebrates.\n\nIn 2010, scientists created \"malaria-resistant mosquitoes\" in the laboratory. The World Health Organization estimated that malaria killed almost one million people in 2008. Genetically modified male mosquitoes containing a lethal gene have been developed to combat the spread of dengue fever and the Zika virus. \"Aedes aegypti\" mosquitoes, the single most important carrier of dengue fever and the Zika virus, were reduced by 80% in a 2010 trial of these GM mosquitoes in the Cayman Islands and by 90% in a 2015 trial in Bahia, Brazil. In comparison, the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District has achieved only 30%-60% population reduction with traps and pesticide spraying. In 2016 FDA approved a genetically modified mosquito intervention for Key West, Florida. UK firm Oxitec proposed the release of millions of modified male (non-biting) mosquitoes to compete with wild males for mates. The males are engineered so that their offspring die before maturing, helping to eradicate mosquito-borne disease. Final approval was to be based on a local referendum to be held in November. Andrea Crisanti, a molecular biologist at Imperial College in London is working on ways to stop the A. gambiae mosquito from transmitting disease.\n\nA strain of \"Pectinophora gossypiella\" (Pink bollworm) has been genetically engineered to express a red fluorescent protein. This allows researchers to monitor bollworms that have been sterilized by radiation and released to reduce bollworm infestation. The strain has been field tested for over three years and has been approved for release.\n\nCnidaria such as \"Hydra\" and the sea anemone \"Nematostella vectensis\" are attractive model organisms to study the evolution of immunity and certain developmental processes. An important technical breakthrough was the development of procedures for generation of stable transgenic hydras and sea anemones by embryo microinjection.\n\nThe regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the use of genetic engineering technology and the development and release of genetically modified organisms (GMO), including genetically modified crops and genetically modified fish. There are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety. The European Union differentiates between approval for cultivation within the EU and approval for import and processing. While only a few GMOs have been approved for cultivation in the EU a number of GMOs have been approved for import and processing. The cultivation of GMOs has triggered a debate about coexistence of GM and nonGM crops. Depending on the coexistence regulations, incentives for cultivation of GM crops differ.\n\nThere is controversy over GMOs, especially with regard to their use in producing food. The dispute involves buyers, biotechnology companies, governmental regulators, nongovernmental organizations, and scientists. The key areas of controversy related to GMO food are whether GM food should be labeled, the role of government regulators, the effect of GM crops on health and the environment, the effect on pesticide resistance, the impact of GM crops for farmers, and the role of GM crops in feeding the world population. In 2014, sales of products that had been labeled as non-GMO grew 30 percent to $1.1 billion.\n\nThere is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.\n\nNo reports of ill effects have been proven in the human population from ingesting GM food. Although labeling of GMO products in the marketplace is required in many countries, it is not required in the United States and no distinction between marketed GMO and non-GMO foods is recognized by the US FDA. In a May 2014 article in \"The Economist\" it was argued that, while GM foods could potentially help feed 842 million malnourished people globally, laws such as the one passed in Vermont, to require labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients, could have the unintended consequence of interrupting the process of spreading GM technologies to impoverished countries that suffer with food security problems.\n\nA 2014 critical review of histopathology studies on rats (eating approved widely eaten GM crops) found significant flaws, inadequacies, and a lack of transparency in methodology and results. Published studies could be found for only 19% of these widely eaten crops. Most of reviewed studies were performed after the approval of crop. More research is needed, including long-term animal feeding studies and thorough histopathological investigations.\n\nThe Organic Consumers Association, and the Union of Concerned Scientists, and Greenpeace stated that risks have not been adequately identified and managed, and they have questioned the objectivity of regulatory authorities. Some health groups say there are unanswered questions regarding the potential long-term impact on human health from food derived from GMOs, and propose mandatory labeling or a moratorium on such products. Concerns include contamination of the non-genetically modified food supply, effects of GMOs on the environment and nature, the rigor of the regulatory process, and consolidation of control of the food supply in companies that make and sell GMOs, or concerns over the use of herbicides with glyphosate.\n\n", "id": "12339", "title": "Genetically modified organism"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12341", "text": "Ghent\n\nGhent (; ; ; ) is a city and a municipality in the Flemish Region of Belgium. It is the capital and largest city of the East Flanders province and after Antwerp the largest municipality of Belgium. The city started as a settlement at the confluence of the Rivers Scheldt and Leie and in the Late Middle Ages became one of the largest and richest cities of northern Europe, with some 50,000 people in 1300. It is a port and university city.\n\nThe municipality comprises the city of Ghent proper and the surrounding towns of Afsnee, Desteldonk, Drongen, Gentbrugge, Ledeberg, Mariakerke, Mendonk, Oostakker, Sint-Amandsberg, Sint-Denijs-Westrem, Sint-Kruis-Winkel, Wondelgem and Zwijnaarde. With 240,191 inhabitants in the beginning of 2009, Ghent is Belgium's second largest municipality by number of inhabitants. The metropolitan area, including the outer commuter zone, covers an area of and has a total population of 594,582 as of 1 January 2008, which ranks it as the fourth most populous in Belgium. The current mayor of Ghent, DaniÃ«l Termont, leads a coalition of the Socialistische Partij Anders, Groen and Open VLD.\n\nThe ten-day-long Ghent Festival (\"Gentse Feesten\" in Dutch) is held every year and attended by about 1â1.5 million visitors.\n\nArchaeological evidence shows human presence in the region of the confluence of Scheldt and Leie going back as far as the Stone Age and the Iron Age.\n\nMost historians believe that the older name for Ghent, 'Ganda', is derived from the Celtic word \"ganda\" which means confluence. Other sources connect its name with an obscure deity named Gontia.\n\nThere are no written records of the Roman period, but archaeological research confirms that the region of Ghent was further inhabited.\n\nWhen the Franks invaded the Roman territories from the end of the 4th century and well into the 5th century, they brought their language with them and Celtic and Latin were replaced by Old Dutch.\n\nAround 650, Saint Amand founded two abbeys in Ghent: St. Peter's (Blandinium) and . The city grew from several nuclei, the abbeys and a commercial centre. Around 800, Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne, appointed Einhard, the biographer of Charlemagne, as abbot of both abbeys. In 851 and 879, the city was however attacked and plundered twice by the Vikings.\n\nWithin the protection of the County of Flanders, the city recovered and flourished from the 11th century, growing to become a small city-state. By the 13th century, Ghent was the biggest city in Europe north of the Alps after Paris; it was bigger than Cologne or Moscow. Within the city walls lived up to 65,000 people. The belfry and the towers of the Saint Bavo Cathedral and Saint Nicholas' Church are just a few examples of the skyline of the period.\n\nThe rivers flowed in an area where much land was periodically flooded. These rich grass 'meersen' (\"water-meadows\": a word related to the English 'marsh') were ideally suited for herding sheep, the wool of which was used for making cloth. During the Middle Ages Ghent was the leading city for cloth.\n\nThe wool industry, originally established at Bruges, created the first European industrialized zone in Ghent in the High Middle Ages. The mercantile zone was so highly developed that wool had to be imported from Scotland and England. This was one of the reasons for Flanders' good relationship with Scotland and England. Ghent was the birthplace of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. Trade with England (but not Scotland) suffered significantly during the Hundred Years' War.\n\nThe city recovered in the 15th century, when Flanders was united with neighbouring provinces under the Dukes of Burgundy. High taxes led to a rebellion and eventually the Battle of Gavere in 1453, in which Ghent suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of Philip the Good. Around this time the centre of political and social importance in the Low Countries started to shift from Flanders (BrugesâGhent) to Brabant (AntwerpâBrussels), although Ghent continued to play an important role. With Bruges, the city led two revolts against Maximilian of Austria, the first monarch of the House of Habsburg to rule Flanders.\n\nIn 1500, Juana of Castile gave birth to Charles V, who became Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Although native to Ghent, he punished the city after the 1539 Revolt of Ghent and obliged the city's nobles to walk in front of the Emperor barefoot with a noose (Dutch: \"\"strop\"\") around the neck; since this incident, the people of Ghent have been called \"\"Stroppendragers\"\" (noose bearers). Saint Bavo Abbey (not to be confused with the nearby Saint Bavo Cathedral) was abolished, torn down, and replaced with a fortress for Royal Spanish troops. Only a small portion of the abbey was spared demolition.\n\nThe late 16th and the 17th centuries brought devastation because of the Eighty Years' War. The war ended the role of Ghent as a centre of international importance. In 1745, the city was captured by French forces during the War of the Austrian Succession before being returned to the Empire of Austriaof the House of Habsburg following the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when this part of Flanders became known as the Austrian Netherlands until 1815, the exile of the French Emperor Napoleon I, the end of the French Revolutionary and later Napoleonic Wars and the peace treaties arrived at by the Congress of Vienna.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the textile industry flourished again in Ghent. Lieven Bauwens, having smuggled the industrial and factory machine plans out of England, introduced the first mechanical weaving machine on the European continent in 1800.\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent, negotiated here and adopted on Christmas Eve 1814, formally ended the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States (the North American phase of the Napoleonic Wars). After the Battle of Waterloo, Ghent and Flanders, previously ruled from the House of Habsburg in Vienna as the Austrian Netherlands, became a part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands with the northern Dutch for 15 years. In this period, Ghent established its own university (1816) and a new connection to the sea (1824â27).\n\nAfter the Belgian Revolution, with the loss of port access to the sea for more than a decade, the local economy collapsed and the first Belgian trade union originated in Ghent. In 1913 there was a world exhibition in Ghent. As a preparation for these festivities, the Sint-Pieters railway station was completed in 1912.\n\nGhent was occupied by the Germans in both World Wars but escaped severe destruction. The life of the people and the German invaders in Ghent during World War I is described by H. Wandt in \"etappenleven te Gent\". In World War II the city was liberated by the British 7th \"Desert Rats\" Armoured Division and local Belgian fighters on 6 September 1944.\n\nAfter the fusions of municipalities in 1965 and 1977, the city is made up of:\n\nThe climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. According to the KÃ¶ppen Climate Classification system, Ghent has a marine west coast climate, abbreviated \"Cfb\" on climate maps.\n\nMuch of the city's medieval architecture remains intact and is remarkably well preserved and restored. Its centre is the largest carfree area in Belgium. Highlights are the Saint Bavo Cathedral with the Ghent Altarpiece, the belfry, the Gravensteen castle, and the splendid architecture along the old Graslei harbour. Ghent has established a blend between comfort of living and history; it is not a city-museum. The city of Ghent also houses three bÃ©guinages and numerous churches including the Saint-Jacob's church, the Saint-Nicolas' church and the Saint Michael's church.\n\nIn the 19th century Ghent's most famous architect, Louis Roelandt, built the university hall Aula, the opera house and the main courthouse. Highlights of modern architecture are the university buildings (the \"Boekentoren\" or Book Tower) by Henry Van de Velde. There are also a few theatres from diverse periods.\n\nThe beguinages, as well as the belfry and adjacent cloth hall, were recognized by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites in 1998 and 1999.\n\nThe Zebrastraat, a social experiment in which an entirely renovated site unites living, economy and culture, can also be found in Ghent.\n\nCampo Santo is a famous Catholic burial site of the nobility and artists.\n\nImportant museums in Ghent are the Museum voor Schone Kunsten (Museum of Fine Arts), with paintings by Hieronymus Bosch, Peter Paul Rubens, and many Flemish masters; the SMAK or Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (City Museum for Contemporary Art), with works of the 20th century, including Joseph Beuys and Andy Warhol; and the Design Museum Gent with masterpieces of Victor Horta and Le Corbusier. The Huis van Alijn (House of the Alijn family) was originally a beguinage and is now a museum for folk art where theatre and puppet shows for children are presented. The \"Museum voor IndustriÃ«le Archeologie en Textiel\" or MIAT displays the industrial strength of Ghent with recreations of workshops and stores from the 1800s and original spinning and weaving machines that remain from the time when the building was a weaving mill. The Ghent City Museum (Stadsmuseum, abbreviated STAM), is committed to recording and explaining the city's past and its inhabitants, and to preserving the present for future generations.\n\nIn Ghent and other regions of East-Flanders, bakeries sell a donut-shaped bun called a \"mastel\" (plural \"mastellen\"), which is basically a bagel. \"Mastellen\" are also called \"Saint Hubert bread\", because on the Saint's feast day, which is 3 November, the bakers bring their batches to the early Mass to be blessed. Traditionally, it was thought that blessed mastellen immunized against rabies.\n\nOther local delicacies are the praline chocolates from local producers such as Leonidas, the cuberdons or 'neuzekes' ('noses'), cone-shaped purple jelly-filled candies, 'babeluten' ('babblers'), hard butterscotch-like candy, and of course, on the more fiery side, the famous 'Tierenteyn', a hot but refined mustard that has some affinity to French 'Dijon' mustard.\n\nStoverij is a classic Flemish meat stew, preferably made with a generous addition of brown 'Trappist' (strong abbey beer) and served with French fries. 'Waterzooi' is a local stew originally made from freshwater fish caught in the rivers and creeks of Ghent, but nowadays often made with chicken instead of fish. It is usually served nouvelle-cuisine-style, and will be supplemented by a large pot on the side.\n\nThe city promotes a meat-free day on Thursdays called \"Donderdag Veggiedag\" with vegetarian food being promoted in public canteens for civil servants and elected councillors, in all city funded schools, and promotion of vegetarian eating options in town (through the distribution of \"veggie street maps\"). This campaign is linked to the recognition of the detrimental environmental effects of meat production, which the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization has established to represent nearly one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nGhent has the world's largest number of vegetarian restaurants per capita.\n\nThe city is host to some big cultural events such as the Gentse Feesten, I Love Techno in Flanders Expo, \"10 Days Off\" musical festival, the International Film Festival of Ghent (with the World Soundtrack Awards) and the . Also, every five years, an extensive botanical exhibition (\"Gentse FloraliÃ«n\") takes place in Flanders Expo in Ghent, attracting numerous visitors to the city.\n\nThe Festival of Flanders had its 50th celebration in 2008. In Ghent it opens with the OdeGand City festivities that takes place on the second Saturday of September. Some 50 concerts take place in diverse locations throughout the medieval inner city and some 250 international artists perform. Other major Flemish cities hold similar events, all of which form part of the Festival of Flanders (Antwerp with \"Laus Polyphoniae\"; Bruges with \"MAfestival\"; Brussels with \"KlaraFestival\"; Limburg with \"Basilica\", Mechelen and Brabant with \"Novecento\" and \"Transit\").\n\nThe numerous parks in the city can also be considered tourist attractions. Most notably, Ghent boasts a nature reserve (Bourgoyen-Ossemeersen, 230 hectare) and a recreation park (Blaarmeersen, 87 hectares).\n\nThe port of Ghent, in the north of the city, is the third largest port of Belgium. It is accessed by the Ghent-Terneuzen Canal, which ends near the Dutch port of Terneuzen on the Western Scheldt. The port houses, among others, large companies like ArcelorMittal, Volvo Cars, Volvo Trucks, Volvo Parts, Honda, and Stora Enso.\n\nThe Ghent University and a number of research oriented companies, such as Ablynx, Innogenetics, Cropdesign and Bayer Cropscience, are situated in the central and southern part of the city.\n\nAs the largest city in East Flanders, Ghent has many hospitals, schools and shopping streets. Flanders Expo, the biggest event hall in Flanders and the second biggest in Belgium, is also located in Ghent. Tourism is becoming a major employer in the local area. \n\nAs one of the largest cities in Belgium, Ghent has a highly developed transport system.\n\nBy car the city is accessible via two motorways:\n\nIn addition Ghent also has two ringways:\n\nThe municipality of Ghent comprises five railway stations:\n\nGhent has an extensive network of public transport lines, operated by \"De Lijn\".\n\n\n\nApart from the city buses mentioned above, Ghent also has numerous regional bus lines connecting it to towns and villages across the procince of East Flnaders. All of these buses stop in at least one of the city's regional bus hubs at either Sint-Pieters Station, Dampoort Station, Zuid or Rabot.\n\nInternational buses connecting Ghent to other European destinations are usually found at the Dampoort Station. A couple of private bus companies such as Eurolines, Megabus and Flixbus operate from the Dampoort bus hub.\n\nBuses to and from Belgium's second airport - Brussels South Airport Charleroi - are operated by Flibco, and can be found at the rear exit of the Sint-Pieters Station.\n\nGhent has the largest designated cyclist area in Europe, with nearly of cycle paths and more than 700 one-way streets, where bikes are allowed to go against the traffic. It also boasts Belgiumâs first cycle street, where cars are considered âguestsâ and must stay behind cyclists.\n\nIn the Belgian first football division Ghent is represented by K.A.A. Gent, who became Belgian football champions for the first time in its history in 2015. Another Ghent football club is KRC Gent-Zeehaven, playing in the Belgian fourth division. A football match at the 1920 Summer Olympics was held in Ghent.\n\nThe Six Days of Flanders, a six-day track cycling race, is held annually, taking place in the Kuipke velodrome in Ghent. In road cycling, the city hosts the start and finish of the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, the traditional opening race of the cobbled classics season. It also lends its name to another cobbled classic, GentâWevelgem, although the race now starts in the nearby city of Deinze.\n\nThe city hosts an annual athletics IAAF event in the Flanders Sports Arena: the Indoor Flanders meeting. Two-time Olympic champion Hicham El Guerrouj set a still-standing world record of 3:48.45 in the mile run in 1997.\n\nThe Flanders Sports Arena was host to the 2015 Davis Cup Final between Belgium and Great Britain.\n\n\nGhent is twinned with:\n\n", "id": "12341", "title": "Ghent"}

Administratively, it is an overseas region consisting of a single overseas department. It has a land area of and an estimated population of 400,132 as of January 2015.\n\nGuadeloupe's two main islands are Basse-Terre to the west and Grande-Terre to the east, which are separated by a narrow strait that is crossed with bridges. They are often referred to as a single island. The department also includes the Dependencies of Guadeloupe which include the smaller islands of Marie-Galante and La DÃ©sirade, and the Ãles des Saintes.\n\nGuadeloupe, like the other overseas departments, is an integral part of France. It is thus part of the European Union and the Eurozone, and its currency is the euro. As an overseas department, Guadeloupe is not part of the Schengen Area. The prefecture (regional capital) of Guadeloupe is the city of Basse-Terre, which lies on the island of the same name. The official language is French, and virtually the entire population except recent arrivals from metropolitan France also speaks Antillean Creole (\"CrÃ©ole GuadeloupÃ©en\").\n\nChristopher Columbus named the island \"Santa MarÃ­a de Guadalupe\" in 1493 after the Virgin Mary, venerated in the Spanish town of Guadalupe, in Extremadura.\n\nThe island was called \"Karukera\" (or \"The Island of Beautiful Waters\") by the Arawak people, who settled on there in 300 AD/CE. During the 8th century, the Caribs came and killed the existing population of Amerindians on the island. \n\nDuring his second trip to the Americas, in November 1493, Christopher Columbus became the first European to land on Guadeloupe, while seeking fresh water. He called it \"Santa MarÃ­a de Guadalupe de Extremadura\", after the image of the Virgin Mary venerated at the Spanish monastery of Villuercas, in Guadalupe, Extremadura. The expedition set ashore just south of Capesterre, but left no settlers behind.\n\nColumbus is credited with discovering the pineapple on the island of Guadeloupe in 1493, although the fruit had long been grown in South America. He called it \"piÃ±a de Indias\", which can be correctly translated as \"pine cone of the Indies.\"\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Caribs fought against the Spanish settlers and repelled them.\n\nAfter successful settlement on the island of St. Christophe (St. Kitts), the French Company of the American Islands delegated Charles Lienard (LiÃ©nard de L'Olive) and Jean Duplessis Ossonville, Lord of Ossonville to colonize one or any of the region's islands, Guadeloupe, Martinique, or Dominica.\n\nDue to Martinique's inhospitable nature, the duo resolved to settle in Guadeloupe in 1635, took possession of the island, and wiped out many of the Carib Amerindians. It was annexed to the kingdom of France in 1674.\n\nOver the next century, the British seized the island several times. The economy benefited from the lucrative sugar trade, which commenced during the closing decades of the 17th century. Guadeloupe produced more sugar than all the British islands combined, worth about Â£6 million a year. The British captured Guadeloupe in 1759. The British government decided that Canada was strategically more important and kept Canada while returning Guadeloupe to France in the Treaty of Paris (1763) that ended the Seven Years War.\n\nIn 1790, following the outbreak of the French Revolution, the monarchists of Guadeloupe refused to obey the new laws of equal rights for the free people of color and attempted to declare independence. The ensuing conflict with the republicans, who were faithful to revolutionary France, caused a fire to break out in Pointe-Ã -Pitre that devastated a third of the town. The monarchists ultimately overcame the republicans and declared independence in 1791. The monarchists then refused to receive the new governor that Paris had appointed in 1792. In 1793, a slave rebellion broke out, which made the upper classes turn to the British and ask them to occupy the island.\n\nIn an effort to take advantage of the chaos ensuing from the French Revolution, Britain seized Guadeloupe in 1794, holding control from 21 April until December 1794, when republican governor Victor Hugues obliged the British general to surrender. Hugues succeeded in freeing the slaves, who then turned on the slave owners who controlled the sugar plantations.\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte issued the Law of 20 May 1802. It restored slavery to all of the colonies captured by the British during the French Revolutionary Wars, but did not apply to certain French overseas possessions such as Guadeloupe, Guyane, and Saint-Domingue. Napoleon sent an expeditionary force to recapture the island from the rebellious slaves. Louis DelgrÃ¨s and a group of revolutionary soldiers killed themselves on the slopes of the Matouba volcano when it became obvious that the invading troops would take control of the island. The occupation force killed approximately 10,000 Guadeloupeans.\n\nOn 4 February 1810 the British once again seized the island and continued to occupy it until 1816. By the Anglo-Swedish alliance of 3 March 1813, it was ceded to Sweden for a brief period of 15 months. During this time the British administration continued in place and British governors continued to govern the island.\n\nIn the Treaty of Paris of 1814, Sweden ceded Guadeloupe once more to France. An ensuing settlement between Sweden and the British gave rise to the Guadeloupe Fund. The Treaty of Vienna in 1815 definitively acknowledged French control of Guadeloupe.\n\nSlavery was finally abolished on the island (and in all French possessions) on 28 May 1848 at the initiative of Victor Schoelcher.\n\nGuadeloupe lost 12,000 of its 150,000 residents in the cholera epidemic of 1865â66.\n\nThe colonial history of Guadeloupe has inspired an increasing number of research publications.\n\nIn 1925, after the trial of Henry Sidambarom (Justice of the Peace and defender of the cause of Indian workers), Raymond PoincarÃ© decided to grant French nationality and the right to vote to Indian citizens.\n\nIn 1946, the colony of Guadeloupe became an overseas department of France. Then in 1974, it became an administrative center. Its deputies sit in the French National Assembly in Paris.\n\nIn 2007 the island communes of Saint-Martin and Saint-BarthÃ©lemy were officially detached from Guadeloupe and became two separate French overseas collectivities with their own local administration. Their combined population was 35,930 and their combined land area was as of the 1999 census. \n\nIn January 2009, an umbrella group of approximately fifty labour union and other associations (known in the local Antillean Creole as the Liyannaj Kont Pwofitasyon (LKP), led by Ãlie Domota) called for a â¬200 ($260 USD) monthly pay increase for the island's low income workers. The protesters have proposed that authorities \"lower business taxes as a top up to company finances\" to pay for the â¬200 pay raises. Employers and business leaders in Guadeloupe have said that they cannot afford the salary increase. The strike lasted 44 days, ending with an accord reached on 5 March 2009. Tourism suffered greatly during this time and affected the 2010 tourist season as well.\n\nThe French Caribbean general strikes exposed deep ethnic, racial, and class tensions and disparities within Guadeloupe.\n\nLocated as the southernmost of the Leeward Islands in the eastern Caribbean Sea, Guadeloupe comprises two main islands: Basse-Terre Island and Grande-Terre, which are separated by a narrow sea channel called Salt River. The adjacent French islands of La DÃ©sirade, Les Saintes, and Marie-Galante are under jurisdiction of Guadeloupe.\n\nWestern Basse-Terre has a rough volcanic relief while eastern Grande-Terre features rolling hills and flat plains. La Grande SoufriÃ¨re is the highest mountain peak in the Lesser Antilles, with an elevation of .\n\nFurther to the north, Saint-BarthÃ©lemy and the northern French part of Saint Martin were previously under the jurisdiction of Guadeloupe but on 7 December 2003, both of these areas voted to become overseas territorial collectivities separate from Guadeloupe, a decision which took effect on 22 February 2007.\n\nThe island was devastated by several hurricanes in modern times:\n\nThe Guadeloupe has a tropical climate tempered by maritime influences and the Trade Winds. We distinguish two seasons in Guadeloupe and nearby islands:\n\nGuadeloupe recorded a population of 402,119 in the 2013 census.\n\nThe population of Guadeloupe is mainly of African or mixed descent of Europeans, Indians, Lebanese, Syrians, Chinese, and Carib Amerindians (remnants of the original pre-European population). The archipelago of Ãles des Saintes is mostly populated by the descendants of colonists from Brittany and Normandy. It is largely Roman Catholic, speaking French and a Creole (Antillean Creole).\n\nThe population of Guadeloupe has been stable recently, with a net increase of only 335 people between the 2008 and 2013 censuses. \n\nIn 2012 the average density population in Guadeloupe was 247.7 inhabitants for every square kilometer, which is very high in comparison to France's 116.5 inhabitants for every square kilometer. One third of the land is devoted to agriculture and all mountains are uninhabitable. This lack of space and shelter makes the density population even higher.\n\nBecause Guadeloupe is a wealthy country in comparison to the surrounding Caribbean islands, immigration is popular. People immigrate to Guadeloupe because of its stronger political stability and greater agricultural job opportunities. However, just because foreigners immigrate to Guadeloupe for its opportunities does not mean the country is economically stable; rather, it is stable in comparison to the surrounding regions/islands.\n\nOver 80% of the population are Roman Catholic. Guadeloupe is in the diocese of Basse-Terre (et Pointe-Ã -Pitre).\n\nIn 2011, life expectancy at birth was recorded at 77.0 years for males and 83.5 for females.\n\nGuadeloupe sends four deputies to the French National Assembly and three senators to the French Senate.\n\nGuadeloupe is divided into two arrondissements (Basse-Terre and Pointe-Ã -Pitre), 21 cantons and 32 communes.\n\nFormerly called the Regional Council of Guadeloupe, following the local elections of March 2015 the administering Assembly now bears the name of the Departmental Council of Guadeloupe.\n\nIn 2006, the GDP per capita of Guadeloupe at market exchange rates, not at PPP, was â¬17,338 (US$21,780).\n\nThe economy of Guadeloupe depends on tourism, agriculture, light industry and services. It is dependent upon France for large subsidies and imports. Unemployment is especially high among the youth.\n\nTourism is a key industry, with 83.3% of tourists visiting from metropolitan France, 10.8% coming from the rest of Europe, 3.4% coming from the United States, 1.5% coming from Canada, 0.4% coming from South America, and 0.6% coming from the rest of the world. An increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the islands.\n\nThe traditional sugar cane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, guinnep, noni, sapotilla, paroka, pikinga, giraumon squash, yam, gourd, plantain, christophine, monbin, prunecafÃ©, cocoa, jackfruit, pomegranate, and many varieties of flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is dependent upon imported food, mainly from France.\n\nLight industry features sugar and rum, solar energy, and many industrial products. Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported.\n\nAs it is a region of France, Guadeloupe's sole official language is French, which is spoken by nearly all of the population.\nIn addition, most of the population can also speak Guadeloupean Creole (GC), a variety of Antillean Creole French. Throughout the island's colonial history, GC was the language of local community, of resistance to European domination, of ethno-racial identity. Consequently, when from the early 1970s to the mid 1980s, Guadeloupe saw the rise and fall of an at-times violent movement for (greater) political independence from France, GC was claimed as key to local cultural pride and unity. In the 1990s, in the wake of the independence movement's demise, GC retained its de-stigmatized status as a symbol of local culture, albeit without de jure support from the state and without de facto being practiced with equal competence in all strata and age groups of society. The third millennium, however, brought greater acceptance of GC on the part of France, such that it was introduced as an elective in public schools. Today, the question as to whether French and GC are stable in Guadeloupe, i.e. whether both languages are practiced widely and competently throughout society, remains a subject of active research.\n\nGuadeloupe's culture is probably best known for the islanders' literary achievements, particularly the poetry of Saint-John Perse, the pseudonym used by Alexis LÃ©ger. Perse won the 1960 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for the soaring flight and the evocative images of his poetry, which, in a visionary fashion, reflects the conditions of our time.\"\n\nGuadeloupe has always had a rich literary output, continued today by many living writers, poets, novelists, essayists and journalists, among them Mesdames Maryse CondÃ© and Simone Schwarz-Bart, .\nMusic and dance are also very popular, and the widely accepted interaction of African, French and Indian cultures has given birth to some original new forms specific to the archipelago. Since the 1970s, Guadeloupean music increasinly claimed the local language, Guadelopean Creole as the preferred language of popular music. Islanders enjoy many local dance styles including zouk, zouk-love, kompa, as well as the modern international dances such as hip hop, etc.\n\nOne of his most famous artists was Henri Debs (1932-2013) a musician and producer of French, origin of Lebanese parents, who made many Caribbean rhythms like Zouk (Soca in Spanish) and BelÃ© heard throughout the Antilles, North, Central, Suramerica and France.\n\nTraditional Guadeloupean music includes \"la biguine\", \"kadans\", cadence-lypso, zouk, and gwo ka such as Anzala and Ti Celeste. Popular music artists and bands such as Experience 7, Francky Vincent, Kassav' (which included Patrick St-Eloi), and Gilles Floro embody the traditional music style of the island and the new generation of music, while some other musical artists, like Tom Frager (who grew up in Guadeloupe), perform colorful reggae music that defines the Guadeloupe island as paradise-like. Many international festivals take place in Guadeloupe, like the Creole Blues Festival, hosted in Marie-Galante. All the Euro-French forms of art are also ubiquitous. The melting pot is emphasized by other communities (from Brazil, Dominican Republic, Haiti, India, Lebanon, Syria), who live on the island and share their cultures.\n\nWhile not in the Guadeloupean style, Catherine Quinol (\"Katrin\"), is known worldwide as the lip-synching icon of the piano-house trio Black Box, who burst on to the music scene in the late 1980s with songs such as \"Ride On Time\". Katrin is, however, a trained singer and she went on to release her own work.\n\nAnother element of Guadeloupean culture is its dress. A few women (particularly of the older generation) wear a unique style of traditional dress, with many layers of colourful fabric, now only worn on special occasions. On festive occasions they also wore a madras (originally a \"kerchief\" from South India) head scarf tied in many different symbolic ways, each with a different name. The headdress could be tied in the \"bat\" style, or the \"firefighter\" style, as well as the \"Guadeloupean woman\". Jewelry, mainly gold, is also important in the Guadeloupean lady's dress, a product of European, African and Indian inspiration.\n\nFrench born dancers, choreographers, comedians Laurent and Larry Bourgeois (known as Les Twins) are also of Guadelupean descent. Noted for their fresh take on hip-hop dance, this twin duo made an impression on the dance world while touring with Cirque du Soleil on the , and with BeyoncÃ© on The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, as well as the On the Run Tour.\n\nGuadeloupe is the most violent overseas French department. The high level of unemployment combined with the legacy of slavery caused violence and crime to rise especially in 2009 and 2010, the years following a great worldwide recession. Since the population is so small, the murder rate is slightly more than that of Paris, however, with a murder rate of 8.2 per 100,000 Guadeloupe is one of the safest islands in the Caribbean. Most of this violence is caused by the drug trade or domestic disputes, and the residents of Guadeloupe describe the island as a place with not a lot of everyday crime.\n\nFootball (soccer) is popular in Guadeloupe, and several notable footballers are of Guadeloupean origin:\nThe national football team experienced success in 2007, advancing all the way to the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup semi-finals, where they were defeated 1â0 by CONCACAF powerhouse Mexico.\n\nNFL, *Jacques Chery was undrafted by the Dallas Cowboys and later traded to the Buffalo Bills based in New York, and he also played in the British American Football League for Manchester Titans, Yorkshire Rams and Doncaster Mustangs.\n\nBasketball is also popular. Best known players are the NBA players MickaÃ«l PiÃ©trus, Johan Petro, Rodrigue Beaubois, and Mickael Gelabale (now playing in Russia), who were born on the island. Utah Jazz star centre Rudy Gobert is also of half guadeloupean descent. Also known is trainer and former player Paul Chonchon, after whom a basketball stadion in Pointe-Ã -Pitre is named.\n\nMany fine track and field athletes, such as Marie-JosÃ© PÃ©rec, Patricia Girard-LÃ©no, Christine Arron, and Wilhem Belocian, are also Guadeloupe natives. Triple Olympic champion Marie-JosÃ© PÃ©rec, fourth-fastest runner Christine Arron, and fencing champion Laura Flessel were all born and raised in Guadeloupe.\n\nEven though Guadeloupe is part of France, it has its own sports teams. Rugby union is a small but rapidly growing sport in Guadeloupe. France international and RC Toulon centre Mathieu Bastareaud (cousin of footballer William Gallas) was born in Guadeloupe.\n\nThe island is also internationally best known for hosting the Karujet RaceÂ â Jet Ski World Championship since 1998. This nine-stage, four-day event attracts competitors from around the world (mostly Caribbeans, Americans, and Europeans). The Karujet, generally made up of seven races around the island, has an established reputation as one of the most difficult championships in which to compete.\n\nThe Route du Rhum is one of the most prominent nautical French sporting events, occurring every four years.\n\nBodybuilder Serge Nubret was born in Anse-Bertrand, Grande-Terre, representing the French state in various bodybuilding competitions throughout the 1960s and 1970s including the IFBB's Mr. Olympia contest, taking 3rd place every year from 1972 to 1974, and 2nd place in 1975. Bodybuilder Marie-Laure Mahabir also hails from Guadeloupe.\nGuadeloupe also has some less conventional sporting groups and associations which include The Skywalkers Parkour Team and Rollers forward, both of which are based in Sainte Anne. The country has also a passion for cycling. It hosted the French Cycling Championships in 2009 and continues to host the Tour de Guadeloupe every year. Guadeloupe also continues to host the Orange Open Guadeloupe tennis tournament since 2011 and the Tour of Guadeloupe sailing which was founded in 1981.\n\nTramway: a tramway project with two lines was voted the 9th of September 2013 by South conurbation Grande-Terre 17. The first phase would link by 2019, northern Abymes in downtown Pointe-Ã -Pitre.\n\nThe second phase, in 2023, would complete the first serving in the university.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12343", "title": "Guadeloupe"}

The rearing of animals is done both on Grande-Terre & Basse-Terre.\n\nOffshore fishing is a traditional source of food, and the main catches. By the end of the 1990s, 11 fishing farms were registered in Guadeloupe and experiments are under way to catch and market fish in order to respond to growing demand. The 1997 catch was 10,518 tons, mainly marine fish with some small amounts of crustaceans and molluscs.\n\nIn 1997, industry in Guadeloupe constituted 9 percent of GDP and provided employment for 17 percent of the labor force. Major industrial activities include sugar refining, rum distilling, food processing, cement and brick manufacture, mineral water bottling, beverage making, chemical making, textile manufacture & electronics assembly. Jarry has an industrial free-port.\n\nThe construction industry employs 12 percent of the workforce in Guadeloupe. Most of the construction sector is dominated by government in the form of public works. Such works provide an enormous boost to the economy and help relieve unemployment. Indeed, the 5,500 public work enterprises in the construction sector comprise 19 percent of all industrial enterprises and engage approximately 10 percent of the entire labor force. Construction has boomed with tourism to construct hotels, apartments and cottages.\n\nIn 1997, the service sector in Guadeloupe contributed 85 percent of GDP and provided employment for 68 percent of the labor force.\n\nTourism accounted for 8.9 percent of GDP in Guadeloupe in 2000. Tourism is the major earner for Guadeloupe. In 2000, the number of tourists to Guadeloupe was 623,000, a decrease from 693,000 tourists in 1998. A high percentage of tourists are from France: 83.3% visit from metropolitan France, 10.8% come from the rest of Europe, 3.4% come from the United States, 1.5% come from Canada, 0.4% come from South America, and 0.6% come from the rest of the world. 350 cruise ships visited Guadeloupe in 1998. Pointe-Ã -Pitre is a cruise ship port. Tourism provides jobs such as hoteliers, waiters, tour guides & taxi drivers.\n\nThere are many shopping centers especially in Pointe-Ã -Pitre where French perfumes, cosmetics & leather goods are sold along with local handicrafts as souvenirs. There is foreign direct investment such as McDonald's, KFC, and Subway have established operations in Guadeloupe. There are a number of small and medium-sized retail outlets. In 2000, three hundred new outlets, mostly in the leisure and supermarket sectors, were created in Guadeloupe alone.\n\nGDP:\nreal exchange rate - US$9.74 billion (in 2006)\n\nGDP - real growth rate:\nNA%\n\nGDP - per capita:\nreal exchange rate - US$21,780 (in 2006)\n\nGDP - composition by sector:\n\"agriculture:\"\n15%\n\"industry:\"\n17%\n\"services:\"\n68% (2002 est.)\n\nPopulation below poverty line:\nNA%\n\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\n\"lowest 10%:\"\nNA%\n\"highest 10%:\"\nNA%\n\nLabour force:\n125,900 (1997)\n\nLabour force - by occupation:\nagriculture 15%, industry 20%, services 65% (2002)\n\nUnemployment rate:\n27.8% (1998)\n\nBudget:\n\"revenues:\"\n$296,3 million\n\"expenditures:\"\n$296,3 million, including capital expenditures of $112,5 million (1996)\n\nIndustries:\nconstruction, cement, rum, sugar, tourism\n\nIndustrial production growth rate:\nNA%\n\nElectricity - production:\n1,165 kWh (2003)\n\nElectricity - production by source:\n\"fossil fuel:\"\n100%\n\"hydro:\"\n0%\n\"nuclear:\"\n0%\n\"other:\"\n0% (1998)\n\nElectricity - consumption:\n1,084 TWh (2003)\n\nElectricity - exports:\n0 kWh (2003)\n\nElectricity - imports:\n0 kWh (2003)\n\nAgriculture - products:\nbananas, sugarcane, tropical fruits and vegetables; cattle, pigs, goats\n\nExports:\nUS$676 million (in 2005)\n\nExports - commodities:\nbananas, sugar, rum\n\nExports - partners:\nFrance 60%, Martinique 18%, US 4% (1997)\n\nImports:\nUS$3.102 billion (in 2005)\n\nImports - commodities:\nfoodstuffs, fuels, vehicles, clothing and other consumer goods, construction materials\n\nImports - partners:\nFrance 63%, Germany 4%, US 3%, Japan 2%, Netherlands Antilles 2% (1997)\n\nDebt - external:\n$NA\n\nEconomic aid - recipient:\n$NA; note - substantial annual French subsidies\n\nCurrency:\n1 Euro (currency sign: â¬; banking code: EUR) = 100 cents\n\nExchange rates:\neuros per US$1 â 1, 3002 (February 2005), 0.9867 (January 2000), 0.9386 (1999); French francs (F) per US$1 â 5.65 (January 1999), 5.8995 (1998), 5.8367 (1997), 5.1155 (1996), 4.9915 (1995)\n\nFiscal year: calendar year\n\n", "id": "12348", "title": "Economy of Guadeloupe"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12353", "text": "Glagolitic script\n\nThe Glagolitic script (, â°â°¾â°°â°³â±â°¾â°»â±â°° \"Glagolitsa\") is the oldest known Slavic alphabet. It was created in the 9th century by Saint Cyril, a Byzantine monk from Thessaloniki. He and his brother, Saint Methodius, were sent by the Byzantine Emperor Michael III in 863 to Great Moravia to spread Christianity among the West Slavs in the area. The brothers decided to translate liturgical books into the Old Slavic language that was understandable to the general population, but as the words of that language could not be easily written by using either the Greek or Latin alphabets, Cyril decided to invent a new script, Glagolitic, which he based on the local dialect of the Slavic tribes from the Byzantine Salonika region.\n\nAfter the deaths of Cyril and Methodius, the Glagolitic alphabet ceased to be used in Moravia, but their students continued to propagate it in the west and south. The Glagolitic alphabet was preserved only by the Croats, using it from the 12th to the 20th century, mostly in liturgy.\n\nThe name was not created until many centuries after the script's creation, and comes from the Old Church Slavonic Ð³Ð»Ð°Ð³Ð¾Ð»Ñ \"glagol\" \"utterance\". The verb \"glagolati\" means \"to speak\". It has been conjectured that the name \"glagolitsa\" developed in Croatia around the 14th century and was derived from the word \"glagolity\", applied to adherents of the liturgy in Slavonic.\n\nIn Old Church Slavonic the name is , (\"Kyrillovitsa\").\n\nThe creation of the characters is popularly attributed to Saints Cyril and Methodius, who may have created them to facilitate the introduction of Christianity. It is believed that the original letters were fitted to Bulgarian (Macedonian dialects specifically).\n\nThe number of letters in the original Glagolitic alphabet is not known, but it may have been close to its presumed Greek model. The 41 letters known today include letters for non-Greek sounds, which may have been added by Saint Cyril, as well as ligatures added in the 12th century under the influence of Cyrillic, as Glagolitic lost its dominance. In later centuries, the number of letters dropped dramatically, to fewer than 30 in modern Croatian and Czech recensions of the Church Slavic language. Twenty-four of the 41 original Glagolitic letters (see table below) probably derive from graphemes of the medieval cursive Greek small alphabet but have been given an ornamental design.\n\nThe source of the other consonantal letters is unknown. If they were added by Cyril, it is likely that they were taken from an alphabet used for Christian scripture. It is frequently proposed that the letters \"sha\" , \"tsi\" , and \"cherv\" were taken from the letters \"shin\" ×© and \"tsadi\" ×¦ of the Hebrew alphabet, and that â° \"zhivete\" derives from Coptic \"janja\" Ïª. However, Cubberley (1996) suggests that if a single prototype were presumed, the most likely source would be Armenian. Other proposals include the Samaritan alphabet, which Cyril learned during his journey to the Khazars in Cherson.\n\nAn alternate theory asserts that Saint Cyril did not develop Glagolitic script, instead improving and codifying a preexisting South Slavic script derived from Linear B. Comparison of Linear A and Linear B with the Glagolitic script finds 20 Glagolitic characters aligning in form and/or phonetics with Linear A and 23 with Linear B.\n\nGlagolitic letters were also used as numbers, similarly to Cyrillic numerals. Unlike Cyrillic numerals, which inherited their numeric value from the corresponding Greek letter (see Greek numerals), Glagolitic letters were assigned values based on their native alphabetic order.\n\nThe two monks later canonized as Saints Cyril and Methodius, brothers from Thessaloniki, were sent to Great Moravia in 862 by the Byzantine emperor at the request of Prince Rastislav, who wanted to weaken the dependence of his country on East Frankish priests. The Glagolitic alphabet, however it originated, was used between 863 and 885 for government and religious documents and books, and at the Great Moravian Academy (\"VeÄ¾komoravskÃ© uÄiliÅ¡te\") founded by the missionaries, where their followers were educated. The Kiev Missal, found in the 19th century in Jerusalem, was dated to the 10th century.\n\nIn 886 an East Frankish bishop of Nitra named Wiching banned the script and jailed 200 followers of Methodius, mostly students of the original academy. They were then dispersed or, according to some sources, sold as slaves by the Franks. Many of them (including Naum, Clement, Angelarious, Sava and Gorazd), however, reached Bulgaria and were commissioned by Boris I of Bulgaria to teach and instruct the future clergy of the state in the Slavic languages. After the adoption of Christianity in Bulgaria in 865, religious ceremonies and Divine Liturgy were conducted in Greek by clergy sent from the Byzantine Empire, using the Byzantine rite. Fearing growing Byzantine influence and weakening of the state, Boris viewed the introduction of the Slavic alphabet and language into church use as a way to preserve the independence of the Bulgarian Empire from Byzantine Constantinople. As a result of Boris' measures, two academies, one in Ohrid and one in Preslav, were founded.\n\nFrom there, the students traveled to other places and spread the use of their alphabet. Some went to Croatia (Dalmatia), where the squared variant arose and where the Glagolitic remained in use for a long time. In 1248, Pope Innocent IV granted the Croats of southern Dalmatia the unique privilege of using their own language and this script in the Roman Rite liturgy. Formally granted to bishop Philip of Senj, the permission to use the Glagolitic liturgy (the Roman Rite conducted in the Slavic language instead of Latin, not the Byzantine rite), actually extended to all Croatian lands, mostly along the Adriatic coast. The Holy See had several Glagolitic missals published in Rome. Authorization for the use of this language was extended to some other Slavic regions between 1886 and 1935. In missals, the Glagolitic script was eventually replaced with the Latin alphabet, but the use of the Slavic language in the Mass continued, until replaced by the modern vernacular languages.\n\nSome students of the Ohrid academy went to Bohemia where the alphabet was used in the 10th and 11th centuries, along with other scripts. It is not clear whether Glagolitic alphabet was used in the Duchy of Kopnik before the Wendish Crusade, but it was certainly used in Kievan Rus'.\n\nIn Croatia, from the 12th century, Glagolitic inscriptions appeared mostly in littoral areas: Istria, Primorje, Kvarner and Kvarner islands, notably Krk, Cres and LoÅ¡inj; in Dalmatia, on the islands of Zadar, but there were also findings in inner Lika and Krbava, reaching to Kupa river, and even as far as MeÄimurje and Slovenia.\nThe Hrvoje's Missal () from 1404 was written in Split, and it is considered one of the most beautiful Croatian Glagolitic books. The 1483 Missale Romanum Glagolitice was the first printed Croatian Glagolitic book.\n\nIt was believed that Glagolitsa in Croatia was present only in those areas. But, in 1992, the discovery of Glagolitic inscriptions in churches along the Orljava river in Slavonia, totally changed the picture (churches in Brodski Drenovac, LovÄiÄ and some others), showing that use of Glagolitic alphabet was spread from Slavonia also.\n\nAt the end of the 9th century, one of these students of Methodius â Naum, who had settled in Preslav (Bulgaria) â created the Cyrillic script, which almost entirely replaced the Glagolitic during the Middle Ages. The Cyrillic alphabet is derived from the Greek alphabet, with (at least 10) letters peculiar to Slavic languages being derived from the Glagolitic. The decision in favor of Cyrillic created an alphabetical difference between the two literary centres of the Bulgarian state in Pliska and Ohrid. In the western part the Glagolitic alphabet remained dominant at first. However, subsequently in the next two centuries, Glagolitic gradually ceased to be used there at all. Nevertheless, particular passages or words written with the Glagolitic alphabet appeared in Bulgarian Cyrillic manuscripts till the end of the 14th century.\n\nSporadic instances aside, Glagolitic survived beyond the 12th century as a primary script in Croatia alone, although from there a brief attempt at reintroduction was made in the West Slavic area in the 14th century. The centre of influence appears to have been in the Kvarner Gulf, though the nature and extent of this influence remain subjects of debate. The early development of the Glagolitic minuscule script alongside the increasingly square majuscule is poorly documented, but before the advent of printing, a mutual relationship evolved between the two varieties; the majuscule being used primarily for inscriptions and higher liturgical uses, and the minuscule being applied to both religious and secular documents. Ignoring the problematic early Slavonian inscriptions, the use of the Glagolitic script at its peak before the Croatian-Ottoman wars corresponded roughly to the area that spoke the Chakavian dialect at the time, in addition to, to varying extents, the adjacent Kajkavian regions within the Zagreb bishopric. As a result, vernacular impact on the liturgical language and script largely stems from Chakavian sub-dialects.\n\nThe first major threat to Croatian Glagolitic since it attained stability was from the Ottoman excursions, though the extent of cultural damage varied locally depending on the course of war. In the 17th century, though, the first successful direct attack on the script since the 12th century was headed by the Bishop of Zagreb, and after the Magnate conspiracy left the script without secular protectors, its use was limited to the littoral region. In the meantime, printing gradually overtook handwriting for liturgical manuscripts, resulting in a decline of the majuscule script, which was absorbed for titular and sometimes initial use within for minuscule documents. It was not until the late 18th century and the onset of modernity that Glagolitic received significant further threats, and through western influence, especially secular, Glagolitic culture collapsed, so that by the mid 19th century, the script was purely liturgical, relying mostly on printed materials. By the time of the devastating Italianization movements under Fascist Italy in the early 20th century, numerous independent events had already greatly reduced the area of the liturgical use of Glagolitic.\n\nThe tradition that the alphabet was designed by Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius has not been universally accepted. A less common belief, contradicting allochthonic Slovene origin, was that the Glagolitic was created or used in the 4th century by St. Jerome (Latin: \"Eusebius Sophronius Hieronymus\"), hence the alphabet is sometimes named Hieronymian.\n\nIt is also acrophonically called azbuki from the names of its first two letters in Bulgaria, on the same model as \"alpha\" + \"beta\". The Slavs of Great Moravia (present-day Slovakia and Moravia), Hungary, Slovenia and Slavonia were called \"SlovÄne\" at that time, which gives rise to the name Slovenish for the alphabet. Some other, rarer, names for this alphabet are Bukvitsa (from common Slavic word \"bukva\" meaning \"letter\", and a suffix \"-itsa\") and Illyrian.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Glagolitsa was also known as \"St. Jerome's script\" due to popular mediaeval legend (created by Croatian scribes in the 13th century) ascribing its invention to St. Jerome (342â429). That claim, however, has been resolutely disproved.\n\nThe epoch of traditional attribution of the script to Jerome ended probably in 1812. In modern times, only certain marginal authors share this view, usually \"re-discovering\" one of the already-known mediaeval sources.\n\nA hypothetical pre-Glagolitic writing system is typically referred to as \"cherty i rezy\" (strokes and incisions) â but no material evidence of the existence of any pre-Glagolitic Slavic writing system has been found, except for a few brief and vague references in old chronicles and \"lives of the saints\". All artifacts presented as evidence of pre-Glagolitic Slavic inscriptions have later been identified as texts in known scripts and in known non-Slavic languages, or as fakes. The well-known Chernorizets Hrabar's \"strokes and incisions\" are usually considered to be a reference to a kind of property mark or alternatively fortune-telling signs. Some \"Ruthenian letters\" found in one version of St. Cyril's life are explainable as misspelled \"Syrian letters\" (in Slavic, the roots are very similar: \"rus-\" vs. \"sur-\" or \"syr-\"), etc.\n\nThe values of many of the letters are thought to have been displaced under Cyrillic influence or to have become confused through the early spread to different dialects so the original values are not always clear. For instance, the letter \"yu\" â°£ is thought to have perhaps originally had the sound /u/ but was displaced by the adoption of an \"ow\" ligature â° under the influence of later Cyrillic. Other letters were late creations after a Cyrillic model.\n\nThe following table lists each letter in its modern order, showing an image of the letter (round variant), the corresponding modern Cyrillic letter, the approximate sound transcribed with the , the name, and suggestions for its origin. Several letters have no modern counterpart.\nNote that \"yery\" (â°â°) is a digraph of either \"yer\" (â°) or \"yerÑ\" (â° ), followed by either \"izhe\" (â°, â°) or \"i\" (â°).\n\nIn older texts, \"uk\" (â°) and three out of four \"yus\"es (â°§, â°¨, â°©) also can be written as digraphs, in two separate parts.\n\nThe order of \"izhe\" (â°, â°) and \"i\" (â°) varies from source to source, as does the order of the various forms of \"yus\" (â°¤, â°§, â°¨, â°©). Correspondence between Glagolitic \"izhe\" (â°, â°) and \"i\" (â°) with Cyrillic \"Ð\" and \"Ð\" is unknown.\n\n\nThe Glagolitic alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in March 2005 with the release of version 4.1.\n\nThe Unicode block for Glagolitic is U+2C00âU+2C5F.\nThe Glagolitic Supplement block (U+1E000âU+1E02F) was added to the Unicode Standard in June, 2016 with the release of version 9.0:\n\nGlagolitic script is the writing system used in the world of \"The Witcher\" video game series. It was also featured as an inscription in one episode of Log Horizon, and as murder mystery clues in season 3 episode 7 of \"The Bridge\". It is also featured, in various uses, in several of the point and click adventure games made by Cateia Games, a Croatian game studio.\n\n\n\n", "id": "12353", "title": "Glagolitic script"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12354", "text": "Greatest common divisor\n\nIn mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, when at least one of them is not zero, is the largest positive integer that is a divisor of both numbers. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.\n\nThe greatest common divisor is also known as the greatest common factor (gcf), highest common factor (hcf), greatest common measure (gcm), or highest common divisor.\n\nThis notion can be extended to polynomials (see Polynomial greatest common divisor) and other commutative rings (see below).\n\nIn this article we will denote the greatest common divisor of two integers \"a\" and \"b\" as gcd(\"a\",\"b\"). Some textbooks use (\"a\",\"b\").\n\nWhat is the greatest common divisor of 54 and 24? \n\nThe number 54 can be expressed as a product of two integers in several different ways:\n\nThus the divisors of 54 are: formula_2\n\nSimilarly, the divisors of 24 are: formula_3\n\nThe numbers that these two lists share in common are the common divisors of 54 and 24:\n\nThe greatest of these is 6. That is, the greatest common divisor of 54 and 24. One writes:\n\nThe greatest common divisor is useful for reducing fractions to be in lowest terms. For example, gcd(42,Â 56)Â =Â 14, therefore,\n\nTwo numbers are called \"relatively prime\", or \"coprime\", if their greatest common divisor equals 1. For example, 9 and 28 are relatively prime.\n\nFor example, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12Â =Â 2) and five squares along the other (60/12Â =Â 5).\n\nGreatest common divisors can in principle be computed by determining the prime factorizations of the two numbers and comparing factors, as in the following example: to compute gcd(18,Â 84), we find the prime factorizations 18Â =Â 2Â Â·Â 3 and 84Â =Â 2Â Â·Â 3Â Â·Â 7 and notice that the \"overlap\" of the two expressions is 2Â Â·Â 3; so gcd(18,Â 84)Â =Â 6. In practice, this method is only feasible for small numbers; computing prime factorizations in general takes far too long.\n\nHere is another concrete example, illustrated by a Venn diagram. Suppose it is desired to find the greatest common divisor of 48 andÂ 180. First, find the prime factorizations of the two numbers:\n\nWhat they share in common is two \"2\"s and a \"3\":\n\nA much more efficient method is the Euclidean algorithm, which uses a division algorithm such as long division in combination with the observation that the gcd of two numbers also divides their difference. To compute gcd(48,18), divide 48 by 18 to get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 12. Then divide 18 by 12 to get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 6. Then divide 12 by 6 to get a remainder of 0, which means that 6 is the gcd. Note that we ignored the quotient in each step except to notice when the remainder reached 0, signalling that we had arrived at the answer. Formally the algorithm can be described as:\n\nwhere\nIf the arguments are both greater than zero then the algorithm can be written in more elementary terms as follows:\n\nThe existence of the Euclidean algorithm places (the decision problem version of) the greatest common divisor problem in P, the class of problems solvable in polynomial time. The GCD problem is not known to be in NC, and so there is no known way to parallelize its computation across many processors; nor is it known to be P-complete, which would imply that it is unlikely to be possible to parallelize GCD computation. In this sense the GCD problem is analogous to e.g. the integer factorization problem, which has no known polynomial-time algorithm, but is not known to be NP-complete. Shallcross et al. showed that a related problem (EUGCD, determining the remainder sequence arising during the Euclidean algorithm) is NC-equivalent to the problem of integer linear programming with two variables; if either problem is in NC or is P-complete, the other is as well. Since NC contains NL, it is also unknown whether a space-efficient algorithm for computing the GCD exists, even for nondeterministic Turing machines.\n\nAlthough the problem is not known to be in NC, parallel algorithms asymptotically faster than the Euclidean algorithm exist; the best known deterministic algorithm is by Chor and Goldreich, which (in the CRCW-PRAM model) can solve the problem in O(\"n\"/log \"n\") time with \"n\" processors. Randomized algorithms can solve the problem in O((log \"n\")) time on formula_13 processors (note this is superpolynomial).\n\nAn alternative method of computing the gcd is the binary gcd method which uses only subtraction and division by 2.\nIn outline the method is as follows: Let \"a\" and \"b\" be the two non negative integers. Also set the integer \"d\" to 0. There are five possibilities:\nAs gcd(\"a\", \"a\") = \"a\", the desired gcd is \"a\"Ã2 (as \"a\" and \"b\" are changed in the other cases, and \"d\" records the number of times that \"a\" and \"b\" have been both divided by 2 in the next step, the gcd of the initial pair is the product of \"a\" by 2).\n\nIn this case 2 is a common divisor. Divide both \"a\" and \"b\" by 2, increment \"d\" by 1 to record the number of times 2 is a common divisor and continue.\n\nIn this case 2 is not a common divisor. Divide \"a\" by 2 and continue.\n\nAs in the previous case 2 is not a common divisor. Divide \"b\" by 2 and continue.\n\nAs gcd(\"a\",\"b\") = gcd(\"b\",\"a\") and we have already considered the case \"a\" = \"b\", we may assume that \"a\" > \"b\". The number \"c\" = \"a\" â \"b\" is smaller than \"a\" yet still positive. Any number that divides \"a\" and \"b\" must also divide \"c\" so every common divisor of \"a\" and \"b\" is also a common divisor of \"b\" and \"c\". Similarly, \"a\" = \"b\" + \"c\" and every common divisor of \"b\" and \"c\" is also a common divisor of \"a\" and \"b\". So the two pairs (\"a\", \"b\") and (\"b\", \"c\") have the same common divisors, and thus gcd(\"a\",\"b\") = gcd(\"b\",\"c\"). Moreover, as \"a\" and \"b\" are both odd, \"c\" is even, and one may replace \"c\" by \"c\"/2 without changing the gcd. Thus the process can be continued with the pair (\"a\", \"b\") replaced by the smaller numbers (\"c\"/2, \"b\").\n\nEach of the above steps reduces at least one of \"a\" and \"b\" towards 0 and so can only be repeated a finite number of times. Thus one must eventually reach the case \"a\" = \"b\", which is the only stopping case. Then, as quoted above, the gcd is \"a\"Ã2.\n\nThis algorithm may easily be programmed as follows:\n\nExample: (\"a\", \"b\", \"d\") = (48, 18, 0) â (24, 9, 1) â (12, 9, 1) â (6, 9, 1) â (3, 9, 1) â (3, 6, 1) â (3, 3, 1) ; the original gcd is thus 2 = 2 times \"a\"= \"b\"= 3, that is 6.\n\nThe Binary GCD algorithm is particularly easy to implement on binary computers. The test for whether a number is divisible by two can be performed by testing the lowest bit in the number. Division by two can be achieved by shifting the input number by one bit. Each step of the algorithm makes at least one such shift. Subtracting two numbers smaller than \"a\" and \"b\" costs formula_14 bit operations. Each step makes at most one such subtraction. The total number of steps is at most the sum of the numbers of bits of \"a\" and \"b\", hence the computational complexity is\n\nFor further details see Binary GCD algorithm.\n\nIf \"a\" and \"b\" are both nonzero, the greatest common divisor of \"a\" and \"b\" can be computed by using least common multiple (lcm) of \"a\" andÂ \"b\":\n\nbut more commonly the lcm is computed from the gcd.\n\nUsing Thomae's function \"f\",\nwhich generalizes to \"a\" and \"b\" rational numbers or commensurable real numbers.\n\nKeith Slavin has shown that for odd \"a\"Â â¥Â 1:\n\nwhich is a function that can be evaluated for complex \"b\". Wolfgang Schramm has shown that\n\nis an entire function in the variable \"b\" for all positive integers \"a\" where \"c\"(\"k\") is Ramanujan's sum. Donald Knuth proved the following reduction:\n\nfor non-negative integers \"a\" and \"b\", where \"a\" and \"b\" are not both zero. More generally\n\nwhich can be proven by considering the Euclidean algorithm in baseÂ \"n\". Another useful identity relates formula_22 to the Euler's totient function:\n\n\nIn 1972, James E. Nymann showed that \"k\" integers, chosen independently and uniformly from {\"1\"...,\"n\"}, are coprime with probability 1/\"Î¶\"(\"k\") as \"n\" goes to infinity, where \"Î¶\" refers to the Riemann zeta function. (See coprime for a derivation.) This result was extended in 1987 to show that the probability that \"k\" random integers have greatest common divisor \"d\" is \"d\"/Î¶(\"k\").\n\nUsing this information, the expected value of the greatest common divisor function can be seen (informally) to not exist when \"k\"Â =Â 2. In this case the probability that the gcd equals \"d\" is \"d\"/Î¶(2), and since Î¶(2) = Ï/6 we have\n\nThis last summation is the harmonic series, which diverges. However, when \"k\"Â â¥Â 3, the expected value is well-defined, and by the above argument, it is\n\nFor \"k\"Â =Â 3, this is approximately equal to 1.3684. For \"k\"Â =Â 4, it is approximatelyÂ 1.1106.\n\nThe notion of greatest common divisor can more generally be defined for elements of an arbitrary commutative ring, although in general there need not exist one for every pair of elements.\n\nIf is a commutative ring, and and are in , then an element of is called a \"common divisor\" of and if it divides both and (that is, if there are elements and in such that \"d\"Â·\"x\"Â =Â \"a\" and \"d\"Â·\"y\"Â =Â \"b\").\nIf is a common divisor of and , and every common divisor of and divides , then is called a \"greatest common divisor\" of and \"b\".\n\nNote that with this definition, two elements and may very well have several greatest common divisors, or none at all. If is an integral domain then any two gcd's of and must be associate elements, since by definition either one must divide the other; indeed if a gcd exists, any one of its associates is a gcd as well. Existence of a gcd is not assured in arbitrary integral domains. However if is a unique factorization domain, then any two elements have a gcd, and more generally this is true in gcd domains.\nIf is a Euclidean domain in which euclidean division is given algorithmically (as is the case for instance when \"R\" = \"F\"[\"X\"] where is a field, or when is the ring of Gaussian integers), then greatest common divisors can be computed using a form of the Euclidean algorithm based on the division procedure.\n\nThe following is an example of an integral domain with two elements that do not have a gcd:\n\nThe elements 2 and 1Â +Â  are two \"maximal common divisors\" (i.e. any common divisor which is a multiple of 2 is associated to 2, the same holds for 1Â +Â , but they are not associated, so there is no greatest common divisor of andÂ \"b\".\n\nCorresponding to the BÃ©zout property we may, in any commutative ring, consider the collection of elements of the form \"pa\"Â +Â \"qb\", where and range over the ring. This is the ideal generated by and , and is denoted simply (\"a\",Â \"b\"). In a ring all of whose ideals are principal (a principal ideal domain or PID), this ideal will be identical with the set of multiples of some ring element \"d\"; then this is a greatest common divisor of and \"b\". But the ideal (\"a\",Â \"b\") can be useful even when there is no greatest common divisor of and \"b\". (Indeed, Ernst Kummer used this ideal as a replacement for a gcd in his treatment of Fermat's Last Theorem, although he envisioned it as the set of multiples of some hypothetical, or \"ideal\", ring element , whence the ring-theoretic term.)\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12354", "title": "Greatest common divisor"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12357", "text": "Gazpacho\n\nGazpacho (; ) is a soup made of raw vegetables and served cold, originating in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia. Gazpacho is widely eaten in Spain and neighbouring Portugal (, \"gaspacho\"), particularly during the hot summers, as it is refreshing and cool.\n\nGazpacho has ancient roots. There are a number of theories of its origin, including as a soup of bread, olive oil, water and garlic that arrived in Spain and Portugal with the Romans and also with the addition of vinegar. Once in Spain, it became a part of Andalusian cuisine, particularly CÃ³rdoba and Seville, using stale bread, garlic, olive oil, salt, and vinegar, similar to ajoblanco.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the red gazpacho evolved when tomatoes were added among the ingredients. This version was spread internationally.\n\nThere are many modern variations of gazpacho, often in different colors and omitting the tomatoes and bread in favor of avocados, cucumbers, parsley, watermelon, grapes, meat stock, seafood, and other ingredients.\n\nIn Andalusia, most gazpacho recipes typically include stale bread, tomato, cucumber, bell pepper, onion and garlic, olive oil, wine vinegar, water, and salt.\n\nThe following is a typical modern method of preparing gazpacho:\n\n\nTraditionally, gazpacho was made by pounding the vegetables in a mortar with a pestle; this more laborious method is still sometimes used as it helps keep the gazpacho cool and avoids the foam and the completely smooth consistency created by blenders and food processors. A traditional way of preparation is to pound garlic cloves in a mortar, add a little soaked stale bread, then olive oil and salt, to make a paste. Then very ripe tomatoes and vinegar are added. In the days before refrigeration the gazpacho was left in an unglazed earthenware pot to cool by evaporation, and some water added.\n\nGazpacho may be served with garnishes, served separately, such as hard boiled eggs and chopped ham (in the salmorejo variety from CÃ³rdoba), chopped almonds, cumin crushed with mint, orange segments, finely chopped green pepper, onion, tomato or cucumber. In Extremadura, gazpacho with local ham, added to the gazpacho rather than as a garnish, is called \"gazpacho extremeÃ±o\". Andalusian sources say that gazpacho should be slightly chilled, but not iced.\n\nIngredients, texture, and how thick the gazpacho is made vary regionally and between families.\n\nSimilar cold raw soups such as salmorejo, porra antequerana and ajoblanco, are also popular in Andalusia, although not as widespread as gazpacho.\n\n\"Gazpacho manchego\", despite its name, is a meat stew, served hot, not a variation on the cold vegetable soup.\n\nIn the historical description of gazpacho it was remarked that the original recipe uses bread, water, vinegar, oil and salt. This recipe is very old in the Iberian Peninsula, going back to Roman times. Every Andalusian region or comarca has its own variety. The humble gazpacho became a very deeply rooted food for peasants and shepherds in the south of Spain. The basic gazpacho gave rise to many variants, some also called gazpacho, others not; some authors have tried to classify all these variations. Gazpachos may be classified by colour: the most usual red ones (which contain tomato), white ones (which contain no tomato, but include dried fruits), and green ones (which are white but contain some spices that make them green). These variants have their basic ingredients in common, garlic paste which works as an emulsifier, bread, olive oil, vinegar and salt. To the traditional ingredients red fruits such as strawberries, muskmelon, etc., may be added, making the gazpacho a bit sweeter. Gazpacho may be served as a starter, main dish, or tapa.\n\nA popular variation comes from the town of Rota in the province of Cadiz. During times of drought there was not enough water to make gazpacho; arranque has the same ingredients as gazpacho, but uses less water and bread, making it a sort of cream. Some people add more bread until it takes on the consistency of a dip.\n\nIn Extremadura, gazpachos are a kind of purÃ©e or thick gazpacho known as \"cojondongo\", or \"cojondongo del gaÃ±Ã¡n\", made of breadcrumbs, garlics, oil, vinegar and on the top of that chopped onions, tomato and peppers.\n\nGazpacho manchego, as its name implies, is made in the east region of La Mancha, in Albacete and nearby areas, and is also popular in other areas in the center and southwest of the country. It is not a cold vegetable soup but a meat stew, whose main ingredients are small game animals or birds such as rabbit, hare, quail, or pigeon and flat bread, and may also include garlic, tomatoes, and mushrooms. It is cooked in a cauldron and served hot. Garlic and tomatoes may be added. Another well-known variant in La Mancha is gazpachos de pastor or galianos. Some other hot meat or fish dishes from several regions are also called gazpachos (gazpacho jumillano, gazpacho de Yecla, gazpacho de Requena, etc.).\n\nGazpacho is often eaten during the very hot and dry summers in Castilla y LeÃ³n. The gazpacho made in La MoraÃ±a in the province of Ãvila has large pieces of vegetables floating in a watery soup.\n\n\n", "id": "12357", "title": "Gazpacho"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12361", "text": "Gnome\n\nA gnome is a diminutive spirit in Renaissance magic and alchemy, first introduced by Paracelsus in the 16th century and later adopted by more recent authors including those of modern fantasy literature. Its characteristics have been reinterpreted to suit the needs of various story tellers, but it is typically said to be a small humanoid that lives underground.\n\nThe word comes from Renaissance Latin \"gnomus\", which first appears in the works of 16th century Swiss alchemist Paracelsus, possibly deriving the term from Latin \"gÄnomos\" (itself representing a Greek , literally \"earth-dweller\"). In this case, the omission of the \"Ä\" is, as the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) calls it, a blunder. Alternatively, the term may be an original invention of Paracelsus.\n\nParacelsus uses \"Gnomi\" as a synonym of \"PygmÃ¦i\", and classifies them as earth elementals. He describes them as two spans high, very reluctant to interact with humans, and able to move through solid earth as easily as humans move through air.\n\nThe chthonic, or earth-dwelling, spirit has precedents in numerous ancient and medieval mythologies, often guarding mines and precious underground treasures, notably in the Germanic dwarves and the Greek Chalybes, Telchines or Dactyls.\n\nThe English word is attested from the early 18th century. Gnomes are used in Alexander Pope's \"The Rape of the Lock\". The creatures from this mock-epic are small, celestial creatures which were prudish women in their past-lives, and now spend all of eternity looking out for prudish women (in parallel to the guardian angels in Catholic belief). Other uses of the term gnome remain obscure until the early 19th century, when it is taken up by authors of Romanticist collections of fairy tales and becomes mostly synonymous with the older word \"goblin\".\n\nPope's stated source, the French satire \"Comte de Gabalis\" (1670), used the term \"gnomide\" to refer to female gnomes (often \"gnomid\" in English translations).\n\nIn 19th century fiction, the chthonic gnome became a sort of antithesis to the more airy or luminous fairy. Nathaniel Hawthorne in \"Twice-Told Tales\" (1837) contrasts the two in \"Small enough to be king of the fairies, and ugly enough to be king of the gnomes\" (cited after OED). Similarly, gnomes are contrasted to elves, as in William Cullen Bryant's \"Little People of the Snow\" (1877), which has \"let us have a tale of elves that ride by night, with jingling reins, or gnomes of the mine\" (cited after OED).\n\nOne of the first movements in Mussorgsky's 1874 work \"Pictures at an Exhibition\", named \"Gnomus\" (Latin for \"The Gnome\"), is written to sound as if a gnome is moving about, his movements constantly changing in speed.\n\nFranz Hartmann in 1895 satirized materialism in an allegorical tale entitled \"Unter den Gnomen im Untersberg\". The English translation appeared in 1896 as \"Among the Gnomes: An Occult Tale of Adventure in the Untersberg\". In this story, the \"Gnomes\" are still clearly subterranean creatures, guarding treasures of gold within the Untersberg mountain.\n\nAs a figure of 19th century fairy tales, the term gnome became largely synonymous with other terms for \"little people\" by the 20th century, such as \"goblin\", \"brownie\", \"kobold\", \"leprechaun\", \"HeinzelmÃ¤nnchen\" and other instances of the \"domestic spirit\" type, losing its strict association with earth or the underground world.\n\nThe name \"gnome\" has been used in the Fantasy genre, typically in a cunning role, e.g. as an inventor.\n\nIn L. Frank Baum's Oz series, the Nomes (so spelled), especially their king, are the chief adversaries of the Oz people. They are ugly, hot-tempered, immortal, round-bodied with spindly legs and arms, have long beards and wild hair, live underground, and are the militant protectors/ hoarders of jewels and precious metals; Baum does not depict any female gnomes. Ruth Plumly Thompson, who continued the series after Baum's death, reverted to the traditional spelling.\n\nIn C. S. Lewis's \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", gnomes, or \"Earthmen\" as they are sometimes called, live in the Underland, a series of subterranean caverns. Unlike the traditional, more humanlike gnomes, they can have a wide variety of physical features and skin colours. They are used as slaves by the Lady of the Green Kirtle.\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien, in the legendarium surrounding his Elves, uses \"Gnomes\" as the initial and later dropped name of the Noldor, the most gifted and technologically minded of his elvish races, in conscious exploitation of the similarity with the word \"gnomic\". \"Gnome\" is thus Tolkien's English loan-translation of the Quenya word \"Noldo\" (plural \"Noldor\"), \"those with knowledge\". Tolkien's \"Gnomes\" are generally tall, beautiful, dark-haired, light-skinned, immortal, and typically wise but suffer from pride, tend towards violence, and have an overweening love of the works of their own hands, particularly gemstones. Many of them live in cities below ground (Nargothrond) or in secluded mountain fortresses (Gondolin). He uses \"Gnomes\" to refer to both males and females. In \"The Father Christmas Letters\", which Tolkien wrote for his children, Red Gnomes are presented as helpful creatures who come from Norway to the North Pole to assist Father Christmas and his Elves in fighting the wicked Goblins.\n\nThe Dutch books \"Gnomes\" and \"The Secret Book of Gnomes\", written by Wil Huygen, deal with gnomes living together in harmony. These same books are the basis for a made-for-TV animated film and the Spanish-animated series \"The World of David the Gnome\" (as well as the spin-off \"Wisdom of the Gnomes\").\n\nIn J. K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter series\", gnomes are pests that inhabit the gardens of witches and wizards. They are small creatures with heads that look like potatoes on small stubby bodies. Gnomes are generally considered harmless but mischievous and may bite with sharp teeth. In the books it is stated that the Weasleys are lenient to gnomes, and tolerate their presence, preferring to throw them out of the garden, rather than more extreme measures.\n\nIn Terry Brooks' Shannara Series gnomes are an offshoot race created after the Great Wars. There are several distinctive classes of gnomes. Gnomes are the smallest race. In \"The Sword of Shannara\" they are considered to be tribal and warlike, the one race that can be the most easily subverted to an evil cause. This is evidenced by their allegiance to the Warlock Lord in \"The Sword of Shannara\" and to the Mord Wraiths in \"The Wishsong of Shannara\".\n\nIn the \"Warcraft\" franchise, particularly as featured in the MMORPG \"World of Warcraft\", gnomes are a race of beings separate from but allied to dwarves and humans, with whom they share the lands of the Eastern Kingdoms. Crafty, intelligent, and smaller than their dwarven brethren, gnomes are one of two races in Azeroth regarded as technologically savvy. It is suggested in lore that the gnomes originally were mechanical creations that at some point became organic lifeforms. In \"World of Warcraft\", gnomes are an exile race, having irradiated their home city of Gnomeregan in an unsuccessful last-ditch effort to drive out marauding foes.\n\nBB's \"The Little Grey Men\" (1942) is a story of the last gnomes in England, little wild men who live by hunting and fishing.\n\n\nAfter World War II (with early references, in ironic use, from the late 1930s) the diminutive figurines introduced as lawn ornaments during the 19th century came to be known as garden gnomes. The image of the gnome changed further during the 1960s to 1970s, when the first plastic garden gnomes were manufactured. These gnomes followed the style of the 1937 depiction of the seven dwarves in \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" by Disney. This \"Disneyfied\" image of the gnome was built upon by the illustrated children's book classic \"The Secret Book of Gnomes\" (1976), in the original Dutch \"Leven en werken van de Kabouter\". Garden gnomes share a resemblance to the Scandinavian tomte and nisse, and the Swedish term \"tomte\" can be translated to \"gnome\" in English.\n\nGarden gnome liberationists such as the Gnome Liberation Front were introduced in France in 1997. They claim that Garden Gnomes deserve the same freedom that any other living creature would have. They are noted to have stolen hundreds of gnomes.\n\nGnome parades are held annually at Atlanta's Inman Park Festival. Numerous one-off gnome parades have been held, including in Savannah, Georgia (April 2012) and Cleveland, Ohio (May 2011).\n\n", "id": "12361", "title": "Gnome"}

Written out in ordinary decimal notation, it is 1 followed by 10 zeroes, that is, a 1 followed by a googol of zeroes.\n\nIn 1920 Edward Kasner's nine-year-old nephew, Milton Sirotta, coined the term \"googol\", which is 10, then proposed the further term \"googolplex\" to be \"one, followed by writing zeroes until you get tired\". Kasner decided to adopt a more formal definition \"because different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have Carnera be a better mathematician than Dr. Einstein, simply because he had more endurance and could write for longer\". It thus became standardized to 10.\n\nA typical book can be printed with 10 zeros (around 400 pages with 50 lines per page and 50 zeros per line). Therefore, it requires 10 such books to print all the zeros of a googolplex (that is, printing a googol of zeros). If such a book would weigh 100 grams, all of them would weigh 10 kilograms. In comparison, Earth's mass is 5.972 x 10 kilograms, and the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy is estimated at 2.5 x 10 kilograms.\n\nIn pure mathematics, there are several notational methods for representing large numbers by which the magnitude of a googolplex could be represented, such as tetration, hyperoperation, Knuth's up-arrow notation, SteinhausâMoser notation, or Conway chained arrow notation.\n\nIn the PBS science program \"\", , astronomer and television personality Carl Sagan estimated that writing a googolplex in full decimal form (i.e., \"10,000,000,000...\") would be physically impossible, since doing so would require more space than is available in the known universe.\n\nOne googol is presumed to be greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe, which has been estimated to be approximately 10. Thus, in the physical world, it is difficult to give examples of numbers that compare to the vastly greater googolplex. However, in analyzing quantum states and black holes, physicist Don Page writes that \"determining experimentally whether or not information is lost down black holes of solar mass ... would require more than 10 measurements to give a rough determination of the final density matrix after a black hole evaporates\". The end of the Universe via Big Freeze without proton decay is expected to be around 10 years into the future.\n\nIn a separate article, Page shows that the number of states in a black hole with a mass roughly equivalent to the Andromeda Galaxy is in the range of a googolplex.\n\nWriting the number would take an extreme amount of time: if a person can write two digits per second, then writing a googolplex would take around about 1.51 years, which is about 1.1 times the accepted age of the universe.\n\nThe residues (mod \"n\") of a googolplex are:\n\n\n", "id": "12365", "title": "Googolplex"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12366", "text": "Graphite\n\nGraphite (), archaically referred to as plumbago, is a crystalline form of carbon, a semimetal, a native element mineral, and one of the allotropes of carbon. Graphite is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions. Therefore, it is used in thermochemistry as the standard state for defining the heat of formation of carbon compounds.\n\nThere are three principal types of natural graphite, each occurring in different types of ore deposits:\n\n\nGraphite occurs in metamorphic rocks as a result of the reduction of sedimentary carbon compounds during metamorphism. It also occurs in igneous rocks and in meteorites. Minerals associated with graphite include quartz, calcite, micas and tourmaline. In meteorites it occurs with troilite and silicate minerals. Small graphitic crystals in meteoritic iron are called cliftonite.\n\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), world production of natural graphite in 2012 was 1,100,000 tonnes, of which the following major exporters are: China (750 kt), India (150 kt), Brazil (75 kt), North Korea (30 kt) and Canada (26 kt). Graphite is not mined in the United States, but U.S. production of synthetic graphite in 2010 was 134 kt valued at $1.07 billion.\n\nGraphite has a layered, planar structure. The individual layers are called graphene. In each layer, the carbon atoms are arranged in a honeycomb lattice with separation of 0.142Â nm, and the distance between planes is 0.335Â nm. Atoms in the plane are bonded covalently, with only three of the four potential bonding sites satisfied. The fourth electron is free to migrate in the plane, making graphite electrically conductive. However, it does not conduct in a direction at right angles to the plane. Bonding between layers is via weak van der Waals bonds, which allows layers of graphite to be easily separated, or to slide past each other.\n\nThe two known forms of graphite, \"alpha\" (hexagonal) and \"beta\" (rhombohedral), have very similar physical properties, except for that the graphene layers stack slightly differently. The alpha graphite may be either flat or buckled. The alpha form can be converted to the beta form through mechanical treatment and the beta form reverts to the alpha form when it is heated above 1300Â Â°C.\n\nThe acoustic and thermal properties of graphite are highly anisotropic, since phonons propagate quickly along the tightly-bound planes, but are slower to travel from one plane to another. Graphite's high thermal stability and electrical and thermal conductivity facilitate its widespread use as electrodes and refractories in high temperature material processing applications. However, in oxygen containing atmospheres graphite readily oxidizes to form CO at temperatures of 700Â Â°C and above.\nGraphite is an electric conductor, consequently, useful in such applications as arc lamp electrodes. It can conduct electricity due to the vast electron delocalization within the carbon layers (a phenomenon called aromaticity). These valence electrons are free to move, so are able to conduct electricity. However, the electricity is primarily conducted within the plane of the layers. The conductive properties of powdered graphite allows its use as pressure sensor in carbon microphones.\n\nGraphite and graphite powder are valued in industrial applications for their self-lubricating and dry lubricating properties. There is a common belief that graphite's lubricating properties are solely due to the loose interlamellar coupling between sheets in the structure. However, it has been shown that in a vacuum environment (such as in technologies for use in space), graphite degrades as a lubricant, due to the hypoxic conditions This observation led to the hypothesis that the lubrication is due to the presence of fluids between the layers, such as air and water, which are naturally adsorbed from the environment. This hypothesis has been refuted by studies showing that air and water are not absorbed. Recent studies suggest that an effect called superlubricity can also account for graphite's lubricating properties. The use of graphite is limited by its tendency to facilitate pitting corrosion in some stainless steel, and to promote galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals (due to its electrical conductivity). It is also corrosive to aluminium in the presence of moisture. For this reason, the US Air Force banned its use as a lubricant in aluminium aircraft, and discouraged its use in aluminium-containing automatic weapons. Even graphite pencil marks on aluminium parts may facilitate corrosion. Another high-temperature lubricant, hexagonal boron nitride, has the same molecular structure as graphite. It is sometimes called \"white graphite\", due to its similar properties.\n\nWhen a large number of crystallographic defects bind these planes together, graphite loses its lubrication properties and becomes what is known as pyrolytic graphite. It is also highly anisotropic, and diamagnetic, thus it will float in mid-air above a strong magnet. If it is made in a fluidized bed at 1000â1300Â Â°C then it is isotropic turbostratic, and is used in blood contacting devices like mechanical heart valves and is called pyrolytic carbon, and is not diamagnetic. Pyrolytic graphite, and pyrolytic carbon are often confused but are very different materials.\n\nNatural and crystalline graphites are not often used in pure form as structural materials, due to their shear-planes, brittleness and inconsistent mechanical properties.\n\nIn the 4th millennium B.C., during the Neolithic Age in southeastern Europe, the MariÅ£a culture used graphite in a ceramic paint for decorating pottery.\n\nSome time before 1565 (some sources say as early as 1500), an enormous deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England, which the locals found very useful for marking sheep. During the reign of Elizabeth I (1533â1603), Borrowdale graphite was used as a refractory material to line moulds for cannonballs, resulting in rounder, smoother balls that could be fired farther, contributing to the strength of the English navy. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and soft, and could easily be cut into sticks. Because of its military importance, this unique mine and its production were strictly controlled by the Crown.\n\nHistorically, graphite was called black lead or plumbago.\nPlumbago was commonly used in its massive mineral form. Both of these names arise from confusion with the similar-appearing lead ores, particularly galena. The Latin word for lead, \"plumbum\", gave its name to the English term for this grey metallic-sheened mineral and even to the leadworts or plumbagos, plants with flowers that resemble this colour.\n\nThe term \"black lead\" usually refers to a powdered or processed graphite, matte black in color.\n\nAbraham Gottlob Werner coined the name \"graphite\" (\"writing stone\") in 1789. He attempted to clear up the confusion between molybdena, plumbago and blacklead after Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1778 proved that there are at least three different minerals. Scheele's analysis showed that the chemical compounds molybdenum sulfide (molybdenite), lead(II) sulfide (galena) and graphite were three different soft black minerals.\n\nNatural graphite is mostly consumed for refractories, batteries, steelmaking, expanded graphite, brake linings, foundry facings and lubricants. Graphene, which occurs naturally in graphite, has unique physical properties and is among the strongest substances known. However, the process of separating it from graphite will require more technological development.\n\nThis end-use began before 1900 with the graphite crucible used to hold molten metal; this is now a minor part of refractories. In the mid-1980s, the carbon-magnesite brick became important, and a bit later the alumina-graphite shape. Currently the order of importance is alumina-graphite shapes, carbon-magnesite brick, monolithics (gunning and ramming mixes), and then crucibles.\n\nCrucibles began using very large flake graphite, and carbon-magnesite brick requiring not quite so large flake graphite; for these and others there is now much more flexibility in size of flake required, and amorphous graphite is no longer restricted to low-end refractories. Alumina-graphite shapes are used as continuous casting ware, such as nozzles and troughs, to convey the molten steel from ladle to mold, and carbon magnesite bricks line steel converters and electric arc furnaces to withstand extreme temperatures. Graphite Blocks are also used in parts of blast furnace linings where the high thermal conductivity of the graphite is critical. High-purity monolithics are often used as a continuous furnace lining instead of the carbon-magnesite bricks.\n\nThe US and European refractories industry had a crisis in 2000â2003, with an indifferent market for steel and a declining refractory consumption per tonne of steel underlying firm buyouts and many plant closures. Many of the plant closures resulted from the acquisition of Harbison-Walker Refractories by RHI AG and some plants had their equipment auctioned off. Since much of the lost capacity was for carbon-magnesite brick, graphite consumption within refractories area moved towards alumina-graphite shapes and monolithics, and away from the brick. The major source of carbon-magnesite brick is now imports from China. Almost all of the above refractories are used to make steel and account for 75% of refractory consumption; the rest is used by a variety of industries, such as cement.\n\nAccording to the USGS, US natural graphite consumption in refractories was 12,500 tonnes in 2010.\n\nThe use of graphite in batteries has been increasing in the last 30 years. Natural and synthetic graphite are used to construct the anode of all major battery technologies. The lithium-ion battery utilizes roughly twice the amount of graphite than lithium carbonate.\n\nThe demand for batteries, primarily nickel-metal-hydride and lithium-ion batteries, has caused a growth in graphite demand in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This growth was driven by portable electronics, such as portable CD players and power tools. Laptops, mobile phones, tablet, and smartphone products have increased the demand for batteries. Electric vehicle batteries are anticipated to increase graphite demand. As an example, a lithium-ion battery in a fully electric Nissan Leaf contains nearly 40Â kg of graphite.\n\nNatural graphite in this end use mostly goes into carbon raising in molten steel, although it can be used to lubricate the dies used to extrude hot steel. Supplying carbon raisers is very competitive, therefore subject to cut-throat pricing from alternatives such as synthetic graphite powder, petroleum coke, and other forms of carbon. A carbon raiser is added to increase the carbon content of the steel to the specified level. An estimate based on USGS US graphite consumption statistics indicates that 10,500 tonnes were used in this fashion in 2005.\n\nNatural amorphous and fine flake graphite are used in brake linings or brake shoes for heavier (nonautomotive) vehicles, and became important with the need to substitute for asbestos. This use has been important for quite some time, but nonasbestos organic (NAO) compositions are beginning to reduce graphite's market share. A brake-lining industry shake-out with some plant closures has not been beneficial, nor has an indifferent automotive market. According to the USGS, US natural graphite consumption in brake linings was 6,510 tonnes in 2005.\n\nA foundry facing mold wash is a water-based paint of amorphous or fine flake graphite. Painting the inside of a mold with it and letting it dry leaves a fine graphite coat that will ease separation of the object cast after the hot metal has cooled. Graphite lubricants are specialty items for use at very high or very low temperatures, as forging die lubricant, an antiseize agent, a gear lubricant for mining machinery, and to lubricate locks. Having low-grit graphite, or even better no-grit graphite (ultra high purity), is highly desirable. It can be used as a dry powder, in water or oil, or as colloidal graphite (a permanent suspension in a liquid). An estimate based on USGS graphite consumption statistics indicates that 2,200 tonnes was used in this fashion in 2005.\n\nThe ability to leave marks on paper and other objects gave graphite its name, given in 1789 by German mineralogist Abraham Gottlob Werner. It stems from \"graphein\", meaning \"to write/draw\" in Ancient Greek.\n\nFrom the 16th Century, pencils were made with leads of English natural graphite, but modern pencil lead is most commonly a mix of powdered graphite and clay; it was invented by Nicolas-Jacques ContÃ© in 1795. It is chemically unrelated to the metal lead, whose ores had a similar appearance, hence the continuation of the name. Plumbago is another older term for natural graphite used for drawing, typically as a lump of the mineral without a wood casing. The term plumbago drawing is normally restricted to 17th and 18th century works, mostly portraits.\n\nToday, pencils are still a small but significant market for natural graphite. Around 7% of the 1.1 million tonnes produced in 2011 was used to make pencils. Low-quality amorphous graphite is used and sourced mainly from China.\n\nNatural graphite has found uses in zinc-carbon batteries, in electric motor brushes, and various specialized applications. Graphite of various hardness or softness results in different qualities and tones when used as an artistic medium. Railroads would often mix powdered graphite with waste oil or linseed oil to create a heat-resistant protective coating for the exposed portions of a steam locomotive's boiler, such as the smokebox or lower part of the firebox.\n\nExpanded graphite is made by immersing natural flake graphite in a bath of chromic acid, then concentrated sulfuric acid, which forces the crystal lattice planes apart, thus expanding the graphite. The expanded graphite can be used to make graphite foil or used directly as \"hot top\" compound to insulate molten metal in a ladle or red-hot steel ingots and decrease heat loss, or as firestops fitted around a fire door or in sheet metal collars surrounding plastic pipe (during a fire, the graphite expands and chars to resist fire penetration and spread), or to make high-performance gasket material for high-temperature use. After being made into graphite foil, the foil is machined and assembled into the bipolar plates in fuel cells.\nThe foil is made into heat sinks for laptop computers which keeps them cool while saving weight, and is made into a foil laminate that can be used in valve packings or made into gaskets. Old-style packings are now a minor member of this grouping: fine flake graphite in oils or greases for uses requiring heat resistance. A GAN estimate of current US natural graphite consumption in this end use is 7,500 tonnes.\n\nGraphite forms intercalation compounds with some metals and small molecules. In these compounds, the host molecule or atom gets \"sandwiched\" between the graphite layers, resulting in a type of compounds with variable stoichiometry. A prominent example of an intercalation compound is potassium graphite, denoted by the formula KC. Graphite intercalation compounds are superconductors. The highest transition temperature (by June 2009) T = 11.5 K is achieved in CaC, and it further increases under applied pressure (15.1 K at 8 GPa).\n\nIn 1893 Charles Street of Le Carbone discovered a process for making artificial graphite. Another process to make synthetic graphite was invented accidentally by Edward Goodrich Acheson (1856â1931). In the mid-1890s, Acheson discovered that overheating carborundum produced almost pure graphite. While studying the effects of high temperature on carborundum, he had found that silicon vaporizes at about 4,150Â Â°C (7,500Â Â°F), leaving the carbon behind in graphitic carbon. This graphite was another major discovery for him, and it became extremely valuable and helpful as a lubricant.\n\nIn 1896 Acheson received a patent for his method of synthesizing graphite, and in 1897 started commercial production. The Acheson Graphite Co. was formed in 1899. In 1928 this company was merged with National Carbon Company (now GrafTech International). Acheson also developed a variety of colloidal graphite products including Oildag and Aquadag. These were later manufactured by the Acheson Colloids Co. (now Acheson Industries, a unit of Henkel AG).\n\nHighly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) is the highest-quality synthetic form of graphite. It is used in scientific research, in particular, as a length standard for scanner calibration of scanning probe microscope.\n\nGraphite electrodes carry the electricity that melts scrap iron and steel, and sometimes direct-reduced iron (DRI), in electric arc furnaces, which are the vast majority of steel furnaces. They are made from petroleum coke after it is mixed with coal tar pitch. They are then extruded and shaped, baked to carbonize the binder (pitch), and finally graphitized by heating it to temperatures approaching 3000Â Â°C, at which the carbon atoms arrange into graphite. They can vary in size up to 11Â feet long and 30 inches in diameter. An increasing proportion of global steel is made using electric arc furnaces, and the electric arc furnace itself is getting more efficient, making more steel per tonne of electrode. An estimate based on USGS data indicates that graphite electrode consumption was 197,000 tonnes in 2005.\n\nElectrolytic aluminium smelting also uses graphitic carbon electrodes. On a much smaller scale, synthetic graphite electrodes are used in electrical discharge machining (EDM), commonly to make injection molds for plastics.\n\nThe powder is made by heating powdered petroleum coke above the temperature of graphitization, sometimes with minor modifications. The graphite scrap comes from pieces of unusable electrode material (in the manufacturing stage or after use) and lathe turnings, usually after crushing and sizing. Most synthetic graphite powder goes to carbon raising in steel (competing with natural graphite), with some used in batteries and brake linings. According to the USGS, US synthetic graphite powder and scrap production was 95,000 tonnes in 2001 (latest data).\n\nSpecial grades of synthetic graphite, such as Gilsocarbon, also find use as a matrix and neutron moderator within nuclear reactors. Its low neutron cross-section also recommends it for use in proposed fusion reactors. Care must be taken that reactor-grade graphite is free of neutron absorbing materials such as boron, widely used as the seed electrode in commercial graphite deposition systemsâthis caused the failure of the Germans' World War II graphite-based nuclear reactors. Since they could not isolate the difficulty they were forced to use far more expensive heavy water moderators. Graphite used for nuclear reactors is often referred to as nuclear graphite.\n\nGraphite (carbon) fiber and carbon nanotubes are also used in carbon fiber reinforced plastics, and in heat-resistant composites such as reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC). Commercial structures made from carbon fiber graphite composites include fishing rods, golf club shafts, bicycle frames, sports car body panels, the fuselage of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and pool cue sticks and have been successfully employed in reinforced concrete, The mechanical properties of carbon fiber graphite-reinforced plastic composites and grey cast iron are strongly influenced by the role of graphite in these materials. In this context, the term \"(100%) graphite\" is often loosely used to refer to a pure mixture of carbon reinforcement and resin, while the term \"composite\" is used for composite materials with additional ingredients.\n\nModern smokeless powder is coated in graphite to prevent the buildup of static charge.\n\nGraphite has been used in at least three radar absorbent materials. It was mixed with rubber in Sumpf and Schornsteinfeger, which were used on U-boat snorkels to reduce their radar cross section. It was also used in tiles on early F-117 Nighthawk (1983)s.\n\nGraphite is mined by both open pit and underground methods. Graphite usually needs beneficiation. This may be carried out by hand-picking the pieces of gangue (rock) and hand-screening the product or by crushing the rock and floating out the graphite. Beneficiation by flotation encounters the difficulty that graphite is very soft and \"marks\" (coats) the particles of gangue. This makes the \"marked\" gangue particles float off with the graphite, yielding impure concentrate. There are two ways of obtaining a commercial concentrate or product: repeated regrinding and floating (up to seven times) to purify the concentrate, or by acid leaching (dissolving) the gangue with hydrofluoric acid (for a silicate gangue) or hydrochloric acid (for a carbonate gangue).\nIn milling, the incoming graphite products and concentrates can be ground before being classified (sized or screened), with the coarser flake size fractions (below 8 mesh, 8â20 mesh, 20â50 mesh) carefully preserved, and then the carbon contents are determined. Some standard blends can be prepared from the different fractions, each with a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. Custom blends can also be made for individual customers who want a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. If flake size is unimportant, the concentrate can be ground more freely. Typical end products include a fine powder for use as a slurry in oil drilling and coatings for foundry molds, carbon raiser in the steel industry (Synthetic graphite powder and powdered petroleum coke can also be used as carbon raiser). Environmental impacts from graphite mills consist of air pollution including fine particulate exposure of workers and also soil contamination from powder spillages leading to heavy metal contamination of soil.\n\nPeople can be exposed to graphite in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, and eye contact.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for graphite exposure in the workplace as a time weighted average (TWA) of 15 million particles per cubic foot (1.5Â mg/m) over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 2.5Â mg/m respirable dust over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 1250Â mg/m, graphite is immediately dangerous to life and health.\n\nThe most common way of recycling graphite occurs when synthetic graphite electrodes are either manufactured and pieces are cut off or lathe turnings are discarded, or the electrode (or other) are used all the way down to the electrode holder. A new electrode replaces the old one, but a sizeable piece of the old electrode remains. This is crushed and sized, and the resulting graphite powder is mostly used to raise the carbon content of molten steel. Graphite-containing refractories are sometimes also recycled, but often not because of their graphite: the largest-volume items, such as carbon-magnesite bricks that contain only 15â25% graphite, usually contain too little graphite. However, some recycled carbon-magnesite brick is used as the basis for furnace-repair materials, and also crushed carbon-magnesite brick is used in slag conditioners. While crucibles have a high graphite content, the volume of crucibles used and then recycled is very small.\n\nA high-quality flake graphite product that closely resembles natural flake graphite can be made from steelmaking kish. Kish is a large-volume near-molten waste skimmed from the molten iron feed to a basic oxygen furnace, and consists of a mix of graphite (precipitated out of the supersaturated iron), lime-rich slag, and some iron. The iron is recycled on site, leaving a mixture of graphite and slag. The best recovery process uses hydraulic classification (which utilizes a flow of water to separate minerals by specific gravity: graphite is light and settles nearly last) to get a 70% graphite rough concentrate. Leaching this concentrate with hydrochloric acid gives a 95% graphite product with a flake size ranging from 10 mesh down.\n\n\n", "id": "12366", "title": "Graphite"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12367", "text": "Garry Trudeau\n\nGarretson Beekman \"Garry\" Trudeau (born July 21, 1948) is an American cartoonist, best known for the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Doonesbury\" comic strip. Trudeau is also the creator and executive producer of the Amazon Studios political comedy series \"Alpha House\".\n\nTrudeau was born in New York City, the son of Jean Douglas (nÃ©e Moore) and Francis Berger Trudeau, Jr. He is the great-grandson of Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau, who created Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis at Saranac Lake, New York. Edward was succeeded by his son Francis and grandson Francis Jr. The latter founded the Trudeau Institute at Saranac Lake, with which his son Garry retains a connection. \n\nAmong his great-great-great-grandfathers were Bishop Richard Channing Moore (through his father) and the New York politician Francis E. Spinner (through his mother). Trudeau is also a descendant of Ãtienne Truteau (1641â1712), first French ancestor of the Trudeaus in America. \nHe has in his ascendant lineage James de Berty Trudeau and Gerardus Beekman, one of the earliest colonial governors of the Province of New York. \n\nHis ancestry is French Canadian, English, Dutch, German, and Swedish.\n\nRaised in Saranac Lake, Trudeau attended the prestigious and elite St. Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire. He enrolled in Yale University in 1966. As an art major, Trudeau initially focused on painting, but soon discovered a greater interest in the graphic arts. He spent much of his time cartooning and writing for Yale's humor magazine \"The Yale Record\", eventually serving as the magazine's editor-in-chief. At the same time, Trudeau began contributing to the \"Yale Daily News\", which eventually led to the creation of \"Bull Tales\", a comic strip parodying the exploits of Yale quarterback Brian Dowling. This strip was the progenitor of \"Doonesbury\".\n\nWhile still an undergraduate at Yale, Trudeau published two collections of \"Bull Tales\": \"Bull Tales\" (1969, published by the \"Yale Daily News\") and \"Michael J.\" (1970, published by \"The Yale Record\"). \n\nAs a senior, Trudeau became a member of Scroll and Key. He did postgraduate work at the Yale School of Art, earning a master of fine arts degree in graphic design in 1973. It was there that Trudeau first met photographer David Levinthal, with whom he would later collaborate on \"Hitler Moves East\", an influential \"graphic chronicle\" of the German invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nSoon after \"Bull Tales\" began running in the Yale student newspaper, the strip caught the attention of the newly formed Universal Press Syndicate. The syndicate's editor, James F. Andrews, recruited Trudeau, changed the strip's name to \"Doonesbury\", and began distributing it following the cartoonist's graduation in 1970. Today \"Doonesbury\" is syndicated to 1,000 daily and Sunday newspapers worldwide and is accessible online in association with \"The Washington Post\" at Doonesbury.com.\n\nIn 1975, Trudeau became the first comic strip artist to win a Pulitzer, traditionally awarded to editorial-page cartoonists. He was also a Pulitzer finalist in 1990, 2004, and 2005. Other awards include the National Cartoonist Society Newspaper Comic Strip Award in 1994, and the Reuben Award in 1995. In 1993, Trudeau was made a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Wiley Miller, fellow comic-strip artist responsible for \"Non Sequitur\", called him \"far and away the most influential editorial cartoonist in the last 25 years\". A regular graduation speaker, Trudeau has received 34 honorary degrees.\n\nIn addition to his creating his strip, Trudeau has worked in both theater and television. He was nominated for an Oscar in 1977 in the category of Animated Short Film for \"A Doonesbury Special\", created for NBC in collaboration with John and Faith Hubley. The film went on to win the Cannes Film Festival Jury Special Prize in 1978. In 1984, with composer Elizabeth Swados, he wrote the book and lyrics for the Broadway musical \"Doonesbury\", for which he was nominated for two Drama Desk Awards. A cast album of the show, recorded for MCA, received a Grammy nomination. Trudeau again collaborated with Swados in 1984, this time on \"Rap Master Ronnie\", a satirical review about the Reagan Administration that opened off-Broadway at the Village Gate. A filmed version, featuring Jon Cryer, the Smothers Brothers, and Carol Kane, was broadcast on Cinemax in 1988.\n\nAlso in 1988, Trudeau wrote and co-produced with director Robert Altman HBO's critically acclaimed Tanner '88, a satiric look at that year's presidential election campaign. The show won the gold medal for Best Television Series at the Cannes Television Festival, the British Academy Television Award for Best Foreign Program, and Best Imported Program from the British Broadcasting Press Guild. It earned an Emmy Award, as well as four ACE Award nominations. In 2004, Trudeau reunited with Altman to write and co-produce a sequel mini-series, Tanner on Tanner, for the Sundance Channel.\n\nIn 1996, \"Newsweek\" and the \"Washington Post\" speculated that Trudeau had written the novel \"Primary Colors\", which was later revealed to have been written by Joe Klein. In February 2000, Trudeau, working with Dotcomix, launched \"Duke2000\", a web-based presidential campaign featuring a real-time, 3-D, streaming-animation version of Duke. Nearly 30 campaign videos were created for the site, and Ambassador Duke was interviewed live by satellite on the Today Show, Larry King Live, The Charlie Rose Show and dozens of local TV and radio news shows.\n\nIn 2013, Trudeau created, wrote and co-produced \"Alpha House\", a political sit-com starring John Goodman that revolves around four Republican U.S. Senators who live together in a townhouse on Capitol Hill. Trudeau was inspired to write the show's pilot after reading a 2007 \"New York Times\" article about a real D.C. townhouse shared by New York Senator Chuck Schumer, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, and California Representative George Miller, all Democrats. The pilot for \"Alpha House\" was produced by Amazon Studios and aired in early 2013. Due to positive response, Amazon picked up the show to develop into a full series, streaming eleven episodes for its first season. On March 31, 2014, Amazon announced that \"Alpha House\" had been renewed. Production began in July 2014, and the entire second season became available for streaming on October 24, 2014.\n\nWhile writing \"Alpha House\", Trudeau put the daily Doonesbury into rerun mode. On March 3, 2014 the \"Classic Doonesbury\" series began, featuring approximately four weeks of daily strips from each year of the strip's run. He continues to produce new strips for Sundays. Although \"Alpha House\" has not been in production since the end of 2014, Trudeau has not returned to creating daily \"Doonesbury\" strips; new material remains a Sunday-only event.\n\nTrudeau has contributed to such publications as \"Harper's\", \"Rolling Stone\", \"The New Republic\", \"The New Yorker\", \"New York\", and \"The Washington Post\". From 1990-94, he wrote and drew an occasional column for \"The New York Times\" op-ed page, and was a contributing essayist for \"Time\" magazine from 1996 to 2001.\n\nBeginning with the Gulf War in 1991, Trudeau has written about military issues extensively. In recognition for his work on wounded warriors, he has been presented with the Commander's Award for Public Service by the Department of the Army, the Commander's Award from Disabled American Veterans, the President's Award for Excellence in the Arts from Vietnam Veterans of America, the Distinguished Public Service Award from the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, the Mental Health Research Advocacy Award from the Yale School of Medicine, and a special citation from the Vet Centers. \n\nHe received several unit commendations from the field during the Gulf War, and traveled with the USO to visit troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. From 2005 to 2014, his website hosted \"The Sandbox\", a milblog posting over 800 essays by deployed soldiers, returned vets, caregivers, and spouses. For most of the strip's run, Trudeau has eschewed merchandising, but starting in 1998 he teamed up with Starbucks to create \"Doonesbury\" products to raise funds for local literacy programs. The items were offered for sale in Starbucks stores for nearly two years and raised over $1 million. Also for charity, Trudeau licensed the strip to Ben & Jerry's, which created a best-selling sorbet flavor called \"Doonesberry\".\n\nTrudeau married Jane Pauley in 1980; they have three children. He maintains a low personal profile. A rare early appearance on television was as a guest on \"To Tell the Truth\" in 1971, where only one of the three panelists guessed his identity. In 1990, Trudeau appeared on the cover of \"Newsweek\" for \"Inside Doonesbury's Brain\", a story written by Jonathan Alter. This was the first interview Trudeau had given in seventeen years. \n\nTrudeau cooperated extensively with \"Wired\" magazine for a 2000 profile, \"The Revolution Will be Satirized\". He later spoke with the writer of that article, Edward Cone, for a 2004 newspaper column in the Greensboro, North Carolina \"News & Record\", about the war wounds suffered by the Doonesbury character \"B.D.\", and in 2006 did a Q&A at Cone's personal blog about The Sandbox. Trudeau granted an interview to \"Rolling Stone\" in 2004 in which he discussed his time at Yale University, which he attended two years behind George W. Bush. He granted another \"Rolling Stone\" interview in 2010. In 2006, \"The Washington Post\" printed an extensive profile of Trudeau by writer Gene Weingarten. He appeared on the \"Charlie Rose\" television program, and at signings for \"The Long Road Home: One Step at a Time\", his \"Doonesbury\" book about B.D.'s struggle with injuries received during the second Gulf War.\n\nOn August 1, 2016, Trudeau appeared on MSNBC on \"The Rachel Maddow Show\". He was brought on to discuss his ability to predict and accurately write about Donald Trump's plans to run for president almost three decades earlier. Maddow presented cartoon strips from as far back as 1987. Trudeau was on her show to promote his new book \"Yuge\", which covers 30 years of Trump appearing in \"Doonesbury\". On November 7, 2016, Trudeau appeared on \"Fresh Air\" with Terry Gross to discuss \"Yuge\".\n\nMedia response through the years has been no less contentious. The \"Saturday Review\" once voted Trudeau one of the \"Most Overrated People in American Arts and Letters\", stating that after his hiatus, his comic strip was \"predictable, mean-spirited, and not as funny as before.\" \n\nIn \"The Daily Caller\", Jim Treacher wrote that Trudeau is a \"dinosaur ... incapable of writing a character who doesn't sound like Trudeau\". Eric Alterman writing in \"The Nation\", called \"Doonesbury\", \"one of the great intellectual/artistic accomplishments of the past half-century, irrespective of category\".\n\nTrudeau's acceptance speech on the occasion of receiving a Polk Award in 2015 for lifetime achievement stirred controversy. In the speech, Trudeau criticized the cartoonists of \"Charlie Hebdo\" -- after a number of \"Charlie Hebdo\" writers, editors and cartoonists had been murdered execution style in their own Paris offices by Muslim terrorists -- for \"punching downward..., attacking a powerless, disenfranchised minority with crude, vulgar drawings closer to graffiti than cartoons\", and thereby wandering \"into the realm of hate speech\" with cartoons of Muhammad.\n\nWriting in \"The Atlantic\", in which Trudeau had published his speech, political commentator David Frum criticized what he called Trudeau's \"moral theory\" that calls for identifying \"the bearer of privilege\", then holding \"the privilege-bearer responsible\".\n\nTrudeau was labelled a \"terror apologist\" by the editors of \"The New York Post\" for his comments and particularly the venue in which he expressed them, i.e. while accepting Long Island University's George Polk award for lifetime achievement in journalism. Trudeau has never retracted, amended or apologized for the comments.\n\n\n", "id": "12367", "title": "Garry Trudeau"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12369", "text": "Guild\n\nA guild is a group of merchants who control the practice of their craft in a particular town. The earliest types of guild were formed as confraternities of tradesmen. They were organized in a manner something between a professional association, trade union, a cartel, and a secret society. They often depended on grants of letters patent by a monarch or other authority to enforce the flow of trade to their self-employed members, and to retain ownership of tools and the supply of materials. A lasting legacy of traditional guilds are the guildhalls constructed and used as meeting places.\n\nAn important result of the guild framework was the emergence of universities at Bologna (established in 1088), Oxford (at least since 1096) and Paris (c. 1150).\n\nIn medieval cities, craftsmen tended to form associations based on their trades, confraternities of textile workers, masons, carpenters, carvers, glass workers, each of whom controlled secrets of traditionally imparted technology, the \"arts\" or \"mysteries\" of their crafts. Usually the founders were free independent master craftsmen who hired apprentices.\n\nThere were several types of guilds, including the two main categories of merchant guilds and craft guilds but also the frith guild and religious guild.\n\nThe continental system of guilds and merchants arrived in England after the Norman Conquest, with incorporated societies of merchants in each town or city holding exclusive rights of doing business there. In many cases they became the governing body of a town. For example, London's Guildhall became the seat of the Court of Common Council of the City of London Corporation, the worldâs oldest continuously elected local government whose members to this day must be Freemen of the City. The Freedom of the City, effective from the Middle Ages until 1835, gave the right to trade, and was only bestowed upon members of a Guild or Livery.\n\nTrade guilds arose in the 14th century as craftsmen united to protect their common interest.\n\nEarly egalitarian communities called \"guilds\" (for the gold deposited in their common funds) were denounced by Catholic clergy for their \"conjurations\"âthe binding oaths sworn among the members to support one another in adversity, kill specific enemies, and back one another in feuds or in business ventures. The occasion for these oaths were drunken banquets held on December 26, the pagan feast of Jul (Yule)âin 858, West Francian Bishop Hincmar sought vainly to Christianize the guilds.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, most of the Roman craft organizations, originally formed as religious confraternities, had disappeared, with the apparent exceptions of stonecutters and perhaps glassmakers, mostly the people that had local skills. Gregory of Tours tells a miraculous tale of a builder whose art and techniques suddenly left him, but were restored by an apparition of the Virgin Mary in a dream. Michel Rouche remarks that the story speaks for the importance of practically transmitted journeymanship.\n\nIn France, guilds were called \"corps de mÃ©tiers\". According to Viktor Ivanovich Rutenburg, \"Within the guild itself there was very little division of labour, which tended to operate rather between the guilds. Thus, according to Ãtienne Boileau's Book of Handicrafts, by the mid-13th century there were no less than 100 guilds in Paris, a figure which by the 14th century had risen to 350.\" There were different guilds of metal-workers: the farriers, knife-makers, locksmiths, chain-forgers, nail-makers, often formed separate and distinct corporations; the armourers were divided into helmet-makers, escutcheon-makers, harness-makers, harness-polishers, etc. In Catalan towns, specially at Barcelona, guilds or \"gremis\" were a basic agent in the society: a shoemakers' guild is recorded in 1202.\n\nIn England, specifically in the City of London Corporation, more than 110 guilds, referred to as livery companies, survive today, with the oldest more than a thousand years old. Other groups, such as the Worshipful Company of Tax Advisers, have been formed far more recently. Membership in a livery company is expected for individuals participating in the governance of \"The City\", as the Lord Mayor and the Remembrancer.\n\nThe guild system reached a mature state in Germany circa 1300 and held on in German cities into the 19th century, with some special privileges for certain occupations remaining today. In the 15th century, Hamburg had 100 guilds, Cologne 80, and LÃ¼beck 70. The latest guilds to develop in Western Europe were the \"\" of Spain: e.g., Valencia (1332) or Toledo (1426).\n\nNot all city economies were controlled by guilds; some cities were \"free.\" Where guilds were in control, they shaped labor, production and trade; they had strong controls over instructional capital, and the modern concepts of a lifetime progression of apprentice to craftsman, and then from journeyman eventually to widely recognized master and grandmaster began to emerge. In order to become a Master, a Journeyman would have to go on a three-year voyage called Journeyman years. The practice of the Journeyman years still exists in Germany and France.\n\nAs production became more specialized, trade guilds were divided and subdivided, eliciting the squabbles over jurisdiction that produced the paperwork by which economic historians trace their development: The metalworking guilds of Nuremberg were divided among dozens of independent trades in the boom economy of the 13th century, and there were 101 trades in Paris by 1260. In Ghent, as in Florence, the woolen textile industry developed as a congeries of specialized guilds. The appearance of the European guilds was tied to the emergent money economy, and to urbanization. Before this time it was not possible to run a money-driven organization, as commodity money was the normal way of doing business.\nThe guild was at the center of European handicraft organization into the 16th century. In France, a resurgence of the guilds in the second half of the 17th century is symptomatic of the monarchy's concerns to impose unity, control production and reap the benefits of transparent structure in the shape of more efficient taxation. \n\nThe guilds were identified with organizations enjoying certain privileges (letters patent), usually issued by the king or state and overseen by local town business authorities (some kind of chamber of commerce). These were the predecessors of the modern patent and trademark system. The guilds also maintained funds in order to support infirm or elderly members, as well as widows and orphans of guild members, funeral benefits, and a 'tramping' allowance for those needing to travel to find work. As the guild system of the City of London declined during the 17th century, the Livery Companies transformed into mutual assistance fraternities along such lines.\n\nEuropean guilds imposed long standardized periods of apprenticeship, and made it difficult for those lacking the capital to set up for themselves or without the approval of their peers to gain access to materials or knowledge, or to sell into certain markets, an area that equally dominated the guilds' concerns. These are defining characteristics of mercantilism in economics, which dominated most European thinking about political economy until the rise of classical economics.\n\nThe guild system survived the emergence of early capitalists, which began to divide guild members into \"haves\" and dependent \"have-nots\". The civil struggles that characterize the 14th-century towns and cities were struggles in part between the greater guilds and the lesser artisanal guilds, which depended on piecework. \"In Florence, they were openly distinguished: the \"Arti maggiori\" and the \"Arti minori\"âalready there was a \"popolo grasso\" and a \"popolo magro\"\". Fiercer struggles were those between essentially conservative guilds and the merchant class, which increasingly came to control the means of production and the capital that could be ventured in expansive schemes, often under the rules of guilds of their own. German social historians trace the \"Zunftrevolution\", the urban revolution of guildmembers against a controlling urban patriciate, sometimes reading into them, however, perceived foretastes of the class struggles of the 19th century.\nIn the countryside, where guild rules did not operate, there was freedom for the entrepreneur with capital to organize cottage industry, a network of cottagers who spun and wove in their own premises on his account, provided with their raw materials, perhaps even their looms, by the capitalist who took a share of the profits. Such a dispersed system could not so easily be controlled where there was a vigorous local market for the raw materials: wool was easily available in sheep-rearing regions, whereas silk was not.\n\nIn Florence, Italy, there were seven to 12 \"greater guilds\" and 14 \"lesser guilds\" the most important of the greater guilds was that for judges and notaries, who handled the legal business of all the other guilds and often served as an arbitrator of disputes. Other greater guilds include the wool, silk, and the money changers' guilds. They prided themselves on a reputation for very high quality work, which was rewarded with premium prices. The guilds fined members who deviated from standards. Other greater guilds included those of doctors, druggists, and furriers. Among the lesser guilds, were those for bakers, saddle makers, ironworkers and other artisans. They had a sizable membership, but lacked the political and social standing necessary to influence city affairs.\n\nThe guild was made up by experienced and confirmed experts in their field of handicraft. They were called master craftsmen. Before a new employee could rise to the level of mastery, he had to go through a schooling period during which he was first called an apprentice. After this period he could rise to the level of journeyman. Apprentices would typically not learn more than the most basic techniques until they were trusted by their peers to keep the guild's or company's secrets.\n\nLike \"journey\", the distance that could be travelled in a day, the title 'journeyman' derives from the French words for 'day' (\"jour\" and \"journÃ©e\") from which came the middle English word \"journei\". Journeymen were able to work for other masters, unlike apprentices, and generally paid by the day and were thus day labourers. After being employed by a master for several years, and after producing a qualifying piece of work, the apprentice was granted the rank of journeyman and was given documents (letters or certificates from his master and/or the guild itself) which certified him as a journeyman and entitled him to travel to other towns and countries to learn the art from other masters. These journeys could span large parts of Europe and were an unofficial way of communicating new methods and techniques, though by no means all journeymen made such travels â they were most common in Germany and Italy, and in other countries journeymen from small cities would often visit the capital.\nAfter this journey and several years of experience, a journeyman could be received as master craftsman, though in some guilds this step could be made straight from apprentice. This would typically require the approval of all masters of a guild, a donation of money and other goods (often omitted for sons of existing members), and the production of a so-called \"masterpiece,' which would illustrate the abilities of the aspiring master craftsman; this was often retained by the guild.\n\nThe medieval guild was established by charters or letters patent or similar authority by the city or the ruler and normally held a monopoly on trade in its craft within the city in which it operated: handicraft workers were forbidden by law to run any business if they were not members of a guild, and only masters were allowed to be members of a guild. Before these privileges were legislated, these groups of handicraft workers were simply called 'handicraft associations'.\n\nThe town authorities might be represented in the guild meetings and thus had a means of controlling the handicraft activities. This was important since towns very often depended on a good reputation for export of a narrow range of products, on which not only the guild's, but the town's, reputation depended. Controls on the association of physical locations to well-known exported products, e.g. wine from the Champagne and Bordeaux regions of France, tin-glazed earthenwares from certain cities in Holland, lace from Chantilly, etc., helped to establish a town's place in global commerce â this led to modern trademarks.\n\nIn many German and Italian cities, the more powerful guilds often had considerable political influence, and sometimes attempted to control the city authorities. In the 14th century, this led to numerous bloody uprisings, during which the guilds dissolved town councils and detained patricians in an attempt to increase their influence. In fourteenth-century north-east Germany, people of Wendish, i.e. Slavic, origin were not allowed to join some guilds. According to Wilhelm Raabe, \"\"down into the eighteenth century no German guild accepted a Wend.\"\"\n\nAs Ogilvie (2004) shows, the guilds negatively affected quality, skills, and innovation. Through what economists now call \"rent-seeking\" they imposed deadweight losses on the economy. Ogilvie says they generated no demonstrable positive externalities and notes that industry began to flourish only after the guilds faded away. Guilds persisted over the centuries because they redistributed resources to politically powerful merchants. On the other hand, Ogilvie agrees, guilds created \"social capital\" of shared norms, common information, mutual sanctions, and collective political action. This social capital benefited guild members, even as it hurt outsiders.\n\nThe guild system became a target of much criticism towards the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. They were believed to oppose free trade and hinder technological innovation, technology transfer and business development. According to several accounts of this time, guilds became increasingly involved in simple territorial struggles against each other and against free practitioners of their arts.\n\nTwo of the most outspoken critics of the guild system were Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith, and all over Europe a tendency to oppose government control over trades in favour of laissez-faire free market systems was growing rapidly and making its way into the political and legal system. The French Revolution saw guilds as a last remnant of feudalism. The Le Chapelier Law of 1791 abolished the guilds in France. Smith wrote in \"The Wealth of Nations\" (Book I, Chapter X, paragraph 72):\n\nKarl Marx in his \"Communist Manifesto\" also criticized the guild system for its rigid gradation of social rank and the relation of oppressor/oppressed entailed by this system. From this time comes the low regard in which some people hold the guilds to this day. In part due to their own inability to control unruly corporate behavior, the tide turned against the guilds.\n\nBecause of industrialization and modernization of the trade and industry, and the rise of powerful nation-states that could directly issue patent and copyright protections â often revealing the trade secrets â the guilds' power faded. After the French Revolution they fell in most European nations through the 19th century, as the guild system was disbanded and replaced by free trade laws. By that time, many former handicraft workers had been forced to seek employment in the emerging manufacturing industries, using not closely guarded techniques but standardized methods controlled by corporations.\n\nGuilds are sometimes said to be the precursors of modern trade unions. Guilds, however, can also be seen as a set of self-employed skilled craftsmen with ownership and control over the materials and tools they needed to produce their goods. Guilds were more like cartels than they were like trade unions (Olson 1982). However, the journeymen organizations, which were at the time illegal, may have been influential.\n\nThe exclusive privilege of a guild to produce certain goods or provide certain services was similar in spirit and character with the original patent systems that surfaced in England in 1624. These systems played a role in ending the guilds' dominance, as trade secret methods were superseded by modern firms directly revealing their techniques, and counting on the state to enforce their legal monopoly.\n\nSome guild traditions still remain in a few handicrafts, in Europe especially among shoemakers and barbers. Some ritual traditions of the guilds were conserved in order organizations such as the Freemasons, allegedly deriving from the Masons Guild, and the Oddfellows, allegedly derived from various smaller guilds. These are, however, not very important economically except as reminders of the responsibilities of some trades toward the public.\n\nModern antitrust law could be said to derive in some ways from the original statutes by which the guilds were abolished in Europe.\n\nThe economic consequences of guilds have led to heated debates among economic historians. On the one side, scholars say that since merchant guilds persisted over long periods they must have been efficient institutions (since inefficient institutions die out). Others say they persisted not because they benefited the entire economy but because they benefited the owners, who used political power to protect them. Ogilvie (2011) says they regulated trade for their own benefit, were monopolies, distorted markets, fixed prices, and restricted entrance into the guild. Ogilvie (2008) argues that their long apprenticeships were unnecessary to acquire skills, and their conservatism reduced the rate of innovation and made the society poorer. She says their main goal was rent seeking, that is, to shift money to the membership at the expense of the entire economy.\n\nEpstein and Prak's book (2008) rejects Ogilvie's conclusions. Specifically, Epstein argues that guilds were cost-sharing rather than rent-seeking institutions. They located and matched masters and likely apprentices through monitored learning. Whereas the acquisition of craft skills required experience-based learning, he argues that this process necessitated many years in apprenticeship.\n\nThe extent to which guilds were able to monopolize markets is also debated.\n\nModern guilds exist in different forms around the world. Scholars from the history of ideas have noticed that consultants play a part similar to that of the journeymen of the guild systems: they often travel a lot, work at many companies and spread new practices and knowledge between companies and corporations.\n\nProfessional organizations replicate guild structure and operation.\nProfessions such as architecture, engineering, geology, and land surveying require varying lengths of apprenticeships before one can gain a \"professional\" certification. These certifications hold great legal weight: most states make them a prerequisite to practicing there.\n\nThomas W. Malone champions a modern variant of the guild structure for modern \"e-lancers\", professionals who do mostly telework for multiple employers. Insurance including any professional liability, intellectual capital protections, an ethical code perhaps enforced by peer pressure and software, and other benefits of a strong association of producers of knowledge, benefit from economies of scale, and may prevent cut-throat competition that leads to inferior services undercutting prices. And, as with historical guilds, such a structure will resist foreign competition. The free software community has from time to time explored a guild-like structure to unite against competition from Microsoft, e.g. Advogato assigns journeyer and master ranks to those committing to work only or mostly on free software.\n\nIn many European countries guilds have experienced a revival as local organizations for craftsmen, primarily in traditional skills. They may function as forums for developing competence and are often the local units of a national employer's organization.\n\nIn the City of London, the ancient guilds survive as Livery Companies, all of which play a ceremonial role in the City's many customs. The City of London Livery Companies maintain strong links with their respective trade, craft or profession, some still retain regulatory, inspection or enforcement roles. The senior members of the City of London Livery Companies (known as Liverymen) elect the Sheriffs and approve the candidates for the office of Lord Mayor of London. Guilds also survive in many other towns and cities the UK including in Preston, Lancashire, as the Preston Guild Merchant where among other celebrations descendants of Burgesses are still admitted into membership. With the City of London Livery Companies the UK have over 300 extant guilds and growing.\n\nIn 1878 the London Livery companies established the City and Guilds of London Institute the forerunner of the engineering school (still called City and Guilds college) at Imperial College London. The aim of the City and Guilds of London Institute was the Advancement of Technical Education. \"City and Guilds\" operates as an examining and accreditation body for vocational, managerial and engineering qualifications from entry-level craft and trade skills up to post-doctoral achievement.\n\nThe Finnish equivalents of honor societies in universities function as guilds.\n\nIn Germany there are no longer any \"ZÃ¼nfte\" (or \"Gilden\" - the terms used were rather different from town to town), nor any restriction of a craft to a privileged corporation. However, under one other name they used to have (albeit more rarely), to wit, \"Innungen\", guilds continue to exist. These corporations are corporations under public law, albeit the membership is voluntary; the president normally comes from the ranks of master-craftsmen and is called \"Obermeister\" (\"Master-in-chief\"). Journeymen elect their own representative bodies, with their president having the traditional title of \"Altgesell\" (Senior Journeyman).<br>\nThere are also \"Craft Chambers\" (\"Handwerkskammern\"), which have less resemblance to ancient guilds in that they are organized for all crafts in a certain region, not just one. In them membership is mandatory, and they serve to establish self-governance of the crafts.\n\nIn the United States guilds exist in several fields.\n\nIn the film and television industry, guild membership is generally a prerequisite for working on major productions in certain capacities. The Screen Actors Guild, Directors Guild of America, Writers Guild of America, East, Writers Guild of America, West and other profession-specific guilds have the ability to exercise strong control in the cinema of the United States as a result of a rigid system of intellectual-property rights and a history of power-brokers also holding guild membership (e.g., DreamWorks founder Steven Spielberg was, and is, a DGA member). These guilds maintain their own contracts with production companies to ensure a certain number of their members are hired for roles in each film or television production, and that their members are paid a minimum of guild \"scale,\" along with other labor protections. These guilds set high standards for membership, and exclude professional actors, writers, etc. who do not abide by the strict rules for competing within the film and television industry in America.\n\nThe Newspaper Guild is a labor union for journalists and other newspaper workers, with over 30,000 members in North America.\n\nReal-estate brokerage offers an example of a modern American guild system. Signs of guild behavior in real-estate brokerage include: standard pricing (6% of the home price), strong affiliation among all practitioners, self-regulation (see National Association of Realtors), strong cultural identity (see realtor), little price variation with quality differences, and traditional methods in use by all practitioners. In September 2005 the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors, challenging NAR practices that (the DOJ asserted) prevent competition from practitioners who use different methods. The DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission in 2005 advocated against state laws, supported by NAR, that disadvantage new kinds of brokers. \"U.S. v. National Assoc. of Realtors\", Civil Action No. 05C-5140 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 7, 2005).\n\nThe practice of law in the United States also exemplifies modern guilds at work. Every state maintains its own bar association, supervised by that state's highest court. The court decides the criteria for entering and staying in the legal profession. In most states, every attorney must become a member of that state's bar association in order to practice law. State laws forbid any person from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law and practicing attorneys are subject to rules of professional conduct that are enforced by the state's high court.\n\nMedical associations comparable to guilds include the state Medical Boards, the American Medical Association, and the American Dental Association. Medical licensing in most states requires specific training, tests and years of low-paid apprenticeship (internship and residency) under harsh working conditions. Even qualified international or out-of-state doctors may not practice without acceptance by the local medical guild (Medical board). Similarly, nurses and physicians' practitioners have their own guilds. A doctor cannot work as a physician's assistant unless (s)he separately trains, tests and apprentices as one.\n\nAustralia is home to The Pharmacy Guild of Australia (the peak association in the pharmacy industry) and the Guild of Commercial Filmmakers (an association of makers of commercial, short and feature films). Australia's fine jewellery industry has members of the Gold and Silversmith's Guild of Australia (GSGA) who practice their manufacturing locally.\n\nGroups called guilds exist in online communities such as massively multiplayer online games.\n\nThese guilds usually represent a group of individuals that share the same interests and goals. While they may be organized around in-game economic production, they generally do not control production. Guilds in online games can range in size from a small group of a few players to massive guilds that have players from around the world.\n\n\n", "id": "12369", "title": "Guild"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12372", "text": "Gradius (video game)\n\nThe arcade version of \"Gradius\" was released internationally outside Japan under the title of Nemesis, although later releases kept the original title. Home versions were released for various platforms, such as the Famicom/NES, the MSX home computer, and the PC Engine, among other formats. The original arcade game and some of the home versions has also been included in various compilation releases and are available for download in services such as the Virtual Console and PlayStation Network.\n\nThe player controls the trans-dimensional spaceship Vic Viper, and must battle waves of enemies through various environments. The game became synonymous with the phrase, \"Destroy the core!\", as the standard of boss battles in the \"Gradius\" series involved combat with a giant craft, in the center of which would be situated one to several blue colored spheres. These bosses would be designed in such a way that there would be a straight passage from the exterior of the giant craft which leads directly to one of these cores. The player must fire shots into this passage while avoiding attack patterns from weapon emplacements on the body of the boss. However, small but destructible walls are situated in this passage, impeding the bullet shots from damaging the core, and must be whittled away by repeated well-placed shots. In a way, these tiny walls represent the boss' shielding gauge until its core is finally vulnerable to attack. Some bosses have the ability to regenerate these walls. When the core has sustained enough hits, it usually changes color from blue to red, indicating that it is in critical condition and its destruction is imminent. Upon the destruction of a core, a piece of the boss may be put out of commission, seeing that it is no longer powered by a core, or if all of the cores are destroyed, the entire boss is defeated and explodes satisfyingly. Note that these cores are not present on the more organic bosses of \"Gradius\". Such bosses have weak spots in places such as a mouth, head or eye.\n\nWhen gameplay begins, the Vic Viper is relatively slow and has only a weak gun. This level of capability is generally insufficient for engaging enemies, but the Vic Viper can gain greater capabilities by collecting and using power-up items. While most arcade games utilize distinct power up-items that each correspond to a specific effect on the player character, \"Gradius\" has a single power-up item. The effect of this power-up item is to advance the currently selected item in a power-up menu that appears at the bottom of the screen. When the desired power-up is highlighted, the player can obtain it by pressing the power-up button, returning the menu to its initial state in which no power-up is highlighted.\n\nPorts of \"Gradius\" were also done for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Microsoft Windows, MSX, NEC PC-8801, Famicom/NES, PC Engine, Virtual Console, Sharp X1, Sharp X68000, Mobile phones, Sega Saturn, PlayStation and Sinclair ZX Spectrum. The game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind \"Feud\". It was also released on Windows Store on December 20, 2013, GameNow in May 2014 and for PlayStation 4's Arcade Archives on January 25 in Japan. The NES version of \"Gradius\" introduced a cheat code that would later become known as the Konami Code, as it would be used in numerous future Konami games. In this game, inputting the code while pausing the game would grant the player's ship multiple power-ups instantly.\n\n\"Gradius\" was also converted for the Nintendo Vs. Series arcade platform. It is identical to the NES version, but includes no cheat codes and allows the player to continue indefinitely. The arcade version of \"Gradius\" is included in the \"Gradius Collection\" for the PlayStation Portable and in \"\" for the Nintendo DS. A version for the Game Boy was also released in 1990 under the European name \"Nemesis\". It is the first portable game in the Gradius series and contains five levels which play similarly to previous Gradius games. Players select the stage and the number of available extra lives at the start. The game was later included in the compilation \"Konami GB Collection Vol. 1\", where it is titled \"Gradius\".\n\n\nThe Western cover art for the NES version claimed that it had sold one million copies in Japan. GameSpot stated that \"Gradius\" was one of the toughest side-scrolling shooter games available on the NES, second only to \"Contra\". IGN has given the game a rating 7 out of 10 for its re-release on the Wii Virtual Console and has hailed it as one of the greatest classic side-scrolling shooter games.\n\n\"Gradius\" spawned several sequels, the first of which was 1986's \"Salamander\". The series has continued into the seventh generation with \"Gradius ReBirth\".\n\n\n", "id": "12372", "title": "Gradius (video game)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12373", "text": "Gamemaster\n\nA gamemaster (GM; also known as game master, game manager, game moderator or referee) is a person who acts as an organizer, officiant for questions regarding rules, arbitrator, and moderator for a multiplayer role-playing game. They are most common in co-operative games in which players work together and are less common in competitive games in which players oppose each other. The act performed by a gamemaster is sometimes referred to as \"Gamemastering\" or simply \"GM'ing\".\n\nThe role of a gamemaster in a traditional role-playing game is to weave the other participants' player-character stories together, control the non-player aspects of the game, create environments in which the players can interact, and solve any player disputes. The basic role of the gamemaster is the same in almost all traditional role-playing games, although differing rule sets make the specific duties of the gamemaster unique to that system.\n\nThe role of a gamemaster in an online game is to enforce the game's rules and provide general customer service. Also, unlike gamemasters in traditional role-playing games, gamemasters for online games in some cases are paid employees.\n\nThe term \"gamemaster\" and the role associated with it could be found in the postal gaming hobby.\nIn a role-playing game context, it was first used by \"Chivalry & Sorcery\". Previous usage in a wargaming context includes Guidon Games 1973 ruleset, \"Ironclad\". In typical play-by-mail games, players control armies or civilizations and mail their chosen actions to the GM. The GM then mails the updated game state to all players on a regular basis.\n\nEach gaming system has its own name for the role of the gamemaster, such as \"judge\", \"narrator\", \"referee\", \"director\", or \"storyteller\", and these terms not only describe the role of the gamemaster in general but also help define how the game is intended to be run. For example, the Storyteller System used in White Wolf Game Studio's storytelling games calls its GM the \"storyteller\", while the rules- and setting-focused \"Marvel Super Heroes\" role-playing game calls its GM the \"judge\". The cartoon inspired role-playing game \"Toon\" calls its GM the \"animator\". A few games apply system- or setting-specific flavorful names to the GM, such as the Hollyhock God (\"Nobilis\", in which the hollyhock represents vanity), or the most famous of such terms, \"Dungeon Master\" (or \"DM\") in \"Dungeons & Dragons\".\n\nThe gamemaster prepares the game session for the players and the characters they play (known as player characters or PCs), describes the events taking place and decides on the outcomes of players' decisions. The gamemaster also keeps track of non-player characters (NPCs) and random encounters, as well as of the general state of the game world. The game session (or \"adventure\") can be metaphorically described as a play, in which the players are the lead actors, and the GM provides the stage, the scenery, the basic plot on which the improvisational script is built, as well as all the bit parts and supporting characters. Gamemasters can also be in charge of RPG board games making the events and setting challenges.\n\nGMs may choose to run a game based on a published game world, with the maps and history already in place; such game worlds often have pre-written adventures. Alternatively, the GM may build their own world and script their own adventures.\n\nA good gamemaster draws the players into the adventure, making it enjoyable for everyone. Good gamemasters have quick minds, sharp wits, and rich imaginations. Gamemasters must also maintain game balance: hideously overpowered monsters \"or\" players are no fun. It was noted, in 1997, that those who favor their left-brain such as skilled code writers usually do not make it in the ethereal gamemaster world of storytelling and verse.\n\n\nIn early virtual worlds gamemasters served as a moderator or administrator; in MUD game masters were called \"wizards\". Gamemastering in the form found in traditional role-playing games has also been used in a semi-automatic virtual worlds. However, human moderation was sometimes considered unfair or out of context in an otherwise automated world.\nAs online games expanded, gamemaster duties expanded to include being a customer service representative for an online community. A gamemaster in such a game is either an experienced volunteer player or an employee of the game's publisher. They enforce the game's rules by banishing spammers, player killers, cheaters, and hackers and by solving players' problems by providing general customer service. For their tasks they use special tools and characters that allow them to do things like teleport to players, summon items, and browse logs that record players' activities. Often, players who feel dissatisfied with the game will blame the GMs directly for any errors or glitches. However, this blame is misdirected as most GMs are not developers and cannot resolve those types of problems.\n\nThe now defunct America Online Online Gaming Forum used to use volunteers selected by applications from its user base. These people were simply referred to as OGFs by other members, and their screennames were indicative of their position (i.e., OGF Moose, etc.). While membership in the Online Gaming Forum had only one real requirement (that is, be a member of AOL), OGFs were given powers quite similar to AOL \"Guides\" and could use them at will to discipline users as they saw appropriate.\n\n\"World of Warcraft\" has employees of Blizzard Entertainment that serve as gamemasters to help users with various problems in gameplay, chat, and other things like account and billing issues. A gamemaster in this game will communicate with players through chat that has blue text and they will also have a special \"GM\" tag and Blizzard logo in front of their names.\n\n\"RuneScape\" has more than 500 moderators employed by Jagex Games Studio to assist players and perform administrative duties in-game and on the site forums. These \"Jagex Moderators\", as they are called, usually have the word \"Mod\" and a gold crown preceding their account names which ordinary players are not permitted to use. The game also has \"Player Moderators\" and \"Forum Moderators\" who are player volunteers helping with moderation, having the ability to mute (block from chatting) other players who violate rules.\n\n\"Battleground Europe\", a medium-sized MMOFPS has a team of \"Game Moderators\", anonymous volunteers who moderate the game.\n\n\"Miniconomy\", a smaller text-based MMO has a team of \"Federals\", experienced players that help moderate the game and interactions.\n\n\"Transformice\", an MMORPG, has a team of volunteer moderators called \"Mods\" who are experienced players that help moderate the game and interactions.\n\nNote that a few games, notably \"Neverwinter Nights\" and \"\", are video game adaptations of tabletop role-playing games that are played online with one player acting as a traditional gamemaster.\n\nGamemastering, sometimes referred to as Orchestration is used in pervasive games to guide players along a trajectory desired by the game author. To ensure proper gamemastering can take place, four components are needed: some kind of sensory system to the game allowing the game masters to know current events, providing dynamic game information; dynamic and static game information lets game masters make informed decisions; decisions need to be actuated into the game, either through the game system or through manual intervention; and finally a communication structure is needed for both diegetic or non-diegetic communication.\n\nEffective gamemastering can require specialized user interfaces that are highly game specific.\n\nSometimes, tabletop GMs simply can not find players interested in either the same setting, product line, or play style in their local neighborhood. The advent of the networked personal computer provided a solution in the form of online chat programs. Appropriately equipped gamemasters can find players online and a group can meet via chat rooms, forums, or other electronic means.\n\nIn contrast to standard tabletop procedure (and to games \"designed\" to be played online), this online chat format significantly changed the balance of duties for a prospective gamemaster. Descriptive text required more preparation, if only via cut-and-paste; acting and voice skills could not be utilized to get the personality of NPCs and monsters across, increasing the value of background music ('assigned' in advance or individually chosen) as a playing aid. The GM was likely to need copies of player-character records, being unable to glance at the originals as in normal face-to-face procedure. The format also forced the issue (particularly when participants were not personally acquainted) of whether to leave all rolling of dice to the GM (making one's own rolls is a privilege not readily surrendered by some players), or to trust all players to honestly report the results of their rolls (the honor system may be strained when it is in a player's best interest to roll well).\n\nHowever, workarounds to these challenges have only increased over time. The use of Wiki software helps GMs and players alike keep track of all manner of game data, sometimes evolving into a home-made gaming supplement. Scripting software allows unwieldy mechanics (e.g. a complicated formula or repetitive die-rolling) to be resolved at the push of a button. Teleconferencing enhances group communication through voice, video, and a shared whiteboard. The use of technology to enable online play is growing, as reflected in products like the D&D Insider.\n\n", "id": "12373", "title": "Gamemaster"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12383", "text": "Genetic engineering\n\nGenetic engineering, also called genetic modification, is the direct manipulation of an organism's genome using biotechnology. It is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel organisms. New DNA may be inserted in the host genome by first isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using molecular cloning methods to generate a DNA sequence, or by synthesizing the DNA, and then inserting this construct into the host organism. Genes may be removed, or \"knocked out\", using a nuclease. Gene targeting is a different technique that uses homologous recombination to change an endogenous gene, and can be used to delete a gene, remove exons, add a gene, or introduce point mutations.\n\nAn organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be a genetically modified organism (GMO). The first GMOs were bacteria generated in 1973 and GM mice in 1974. Insulin-producing bacteria were commercialized in 1982 and genetically modified food has been sold since 1994. GloFish, the first GMO designed as a pet, was first sold in the United States in December 2003.\n\nGenetic engineering techniques have been applied in numerous fields including research, agriculture, industrial biotechnology, and medicine. Enzymes used in laundry detergent and medicines such as insulin and human growth hormone are now manufactured in GM cells, experimental GM cell lines and GM animals such as mice or zebrafish are being used for research purposes, and genetically modified crops have been commercialized.\n\nGenetic engineering alters the genetic make-up of an organism using techniques that remove heritable material or that introduce DNA prepared outside the organism either directly into the host or into a cell that is then fused or hybridized with the host. This involves using recombinant nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) techniques to form new combinations of heritable genetic material followed by the incorporation of that material either indirectly through a vector system or directly through micro-injection, macro-injection and micro-encapsulation techniques.\n\nGenetic engineering does not normally include traditional animal and plant breeding, in vitro fertilisation, induction of polyploidy, mutagenesis and cell fusion techniques that do not use recombinant nucleic acids or a genetically modified organism in the process. However the European Commission has also defined genetic engineering broadly as including selective breeding and other means of artificial selection. Cloning and stem cell research, although not considered genetic engineering, are closely related and genetic engineering can be used within them. Synthetic biology is an emerging discipline that takes genetic engineering a step further by introducing artificially synthesized material from raw materials into an organism.\n\nIf genetic material from another species is added to the host, the resulting organism is called transgenic. If genetic material from the same species or a species that can naturally breed with the host is used the resulting organism is called cisgenic. Genetic engineering can also be used to remove genetic material from the target organism, creating a gene knockout organism. In Europe genetic modification is synonymous with genetic engineering while within the United States of America it can also refer to conventional breeding methods. The Canadian regulatory system is based on whether a product has novel features regardless of method of origin. In other words, a product is regulated as genetically modified if it carries some trait not previously found in the species whether it was generated using traditional breeding methods (e.g., selective breeding, cell fusion, mutation breeding) or genetic engineering. Within the scientific community, the term \"genetic engineering\" is not commonly used; more specific terms such as \"transgenic\" are preferred.\n\nPlants, animals or micro organisms that have changed through genetic engineering are termed genetically modified organisms or GMOs. Bacteria were the first organisms to be genetically modified. Plasmid DNA containing new genes can be inserted into the bacterial cell and the bacteria will then express those genes. These genes can code for medicines or enzymes that process food and other substrates. Plants have been modified for insect protection, herbicide resistance, virus resistance, enhanced nutrition, tolerance to environmental pressures and the production of edible vaccines. Most commercialised GMOs are insect resistant and/or herbicide tolerant crop plants. Genetically modified animals have been used for research, model animals and the production of agricultural or pharmaceutical products.\n\nThe genetically modified animals include animals with genes knocked out, increased susceptibility to disease, hormones for extra growth and the ability to express proteins in their milk.\n\nHumans have altered the genomes of species for thousands of years through selective breeding, or artificial selection as contrasted with natural selection, and more recently through mutagenesis. Genetic engineering as the direct manipulation of DNA by humans outside breeding and mutations has only existed since the 1970s. The term \"genetic engineering\" was first coined by Jack Williamson in his science fiction novel \"Dragon's Island\", published in 1951 â one year before DNA's role in heredity was confirmed by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase, and two years before James Watson and Francis Crick showed that the DNA molecule has a double-helix structure â though the general concept of direct genetic manipulation was explored in rudimentary form in Stanley G. Weinbaum's 1936 science fiction story \"Proteus Island\".\n\nIn 1972, Paul Berg created the first recombinant DNA molecules by combining DNA from the monkey virus SV40 with that of the lambda virus. In 1973 Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen created the first transgenic organism by inserting antibiotic resistance genes into the plasmid of an \"E. coli\" bacterium. A year later Rudolf Jaenisch created a transgenic mouse by introducing foreign DNA into its embryo, making it the worldâs first transgenic animal. These achievements led to concerns in the scientific community about potential risks from genetic engineering, which were first discussed in depth at the Asilomar Conference in 1975. One of the main recommendations from this meeting was that government oversight of recombinant DNA research should be established until the technology was deemed safe.\n\nIn 1976 Genentech, the first genetic engineering company, was founded by Herbert Boyer and Robert Swanson and a year later the company produced a human protein (somatostatin) in \"E.coli\". Genentech announced the production of genetically engineered human insulin in 1978. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court in the \"Diamond v. Chakrabarty\" case ruled that genetically altered life could be patented. The insulin produced by bacteria, branded humulin, was approved for release by the Food and Drug Administration in 1982.\n\nIn the 1970s graduate student Steven Lindow of the University of WisconsinâMadison with D.C. Arny and C. Upper found a bacterium he identified as \"P. syringae\" that played a role in ice nucleation, and in 1977 he discovered a mutant ice-minus strain. Dr. Lindow (who is now a plant pathologist at the University of California-Berkeley) later successfully created a recombinant ice-minus strain. In 1983, a biotech company, Advanced Genetic Sciences (AGS) applied for U.S. government authorization to perform field tests with the ice-minus strain of \"P. syringae\" to protect crops from frost, but environmental groups and protestors delayed the field tests for four years with legal challenges. In 1987, the ice-minus strain of \"P. syringae\" became the first genetically modified organism (GMO) to be released into the environment when a strawberry field and a potato field in California were sprayed with it. Both test fields were attacked by activist groups the night before the tests occurred: \"The world's first trial site attracted the world's first field trasher\".\n\nThe first field trials of genetically engineered plants occurred in France and the USA in 1986, tobacco plants were engineered to be resistant to herbicides. The Peopleâs Republic of China was the first country to commercialize transgenic plants, introducing a virus-resistant tobacco in 1992. In 1994 Calgene attained approval to commercially release the Flavr Savr tomato, a tomato engineered to have a longer shelf life. In 1994, the European Union approved tobacco engineered to be resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil, making it the first genetically engineered crop commercialized in Europe. In 1995, Bt Potato was approved safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, after having been approved by the FDA, making it the first pesticide producing crop to be approved in the USA. In 2009 11 transgenic crops were grown commercially in 25 countries, the largest of which by area grown were the USA, Brazil, Argentina, India, Canada, China, Paraguay and South Africa.\n\nIn 2010, scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute created the first synthetic genome and inserted it into an empty bacterial cell. The resulting bacterium, named Synthia, could replicate and produce proteins. In 2014, a bacterium was developed that replicated a plasmid containing a unique base pair, creating the first organism engineered to use an expanded genetic alphabet.\n\nThe first step is to choose and isolate the gene that will be inserted into the genetically modified organism. The gene can be isolated using restriction enzymes to cut DNA into fragments and gel electrophoresis to separate them out according to length. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can also be used to amplify up a gene segment, which can then be isolated through gel electrophoresis. If the chosen gene or the donor organism's genome has been well studied it may be present in a genetic library. If the DNA sequence is known, but no copies of the gene are available, it can be artificially synthesized.\n\nThe gene to be inserted into the genetically modified organism must be combined with other genetic elements in order for it to work properly. The gene can also be modified at this stage for better expression or effectiveness. As well as the gene to be inserted most constructs contain a promoter and terminator region as well as a selectable marker gene. The promoter region initiates transcription of the gene and can be used to control the location and level of gene expression, while the terminator region ends transcription. The selectable marker, which in most cases confers antibiotic resistance to the organism it is expressed in, is needed to determine which cells are transformed with the new gene. The constructs are made using recombinant DNA techniques, such as restriction digests, ligations and molecular cloning. The manipulation of the DNA generally occurs within a plasmid.\n\nThe most common form of genetic engineering involves inserting new genetic material randomly within the host genome. Other techniques allow new genetic material to be inserted at a specific location in the host genome or generate mutations at desired genomic loci capable of knocking out endogenous genes. The technique of gene targeting uses homologous recombination to target desired changes to a specific endogenous gene. This tends to occur at a relatively low frequency in plants and animals and generally requires the use of selectable markers. The frequency of gene targeting can be greatly enhanced with the use of engineered nucleases such as zinc finger nucleases, engineered homing endonucleases, or nucleases created from TAL effectors.\n\nIn addition to enhancing gene targeting, engineered nucleases can also be used to introduce mutations at endogenous genes that generate a gene knockout.\n\nOnly about 1% of bacteria are naturally capable of taking up foreign DNA. However, this ability can be induced in other bacteria via stress (e.g. thermal or electric shock), thereby increasing the cell membrane's permeability to DNA; up-taken DNA can either integrate with the genome or exist as extrachromosomal DNA. DNA is generally inserted into animal cells using microinjection, where it can be injected through the cell's nuclear envelope directly into the nucleus or through the use of viral vectors. In plants the DNA is generally inserted using \"Agrobacterium\"-mediated recombination or biolistics.\n\nIn \"Agrobacterium\"-mediated recombination, the plasmid construct contains T-DNA, DNA which is responsible for insertion of the DNA into the host plants genome. This plasmid is transformed into \"Agrobacterium\" containing no plasmids prior to infecting the plant cells. The \"Agrobacterium\" will then naturally insert the genetic material into the plant cells. In biolistics transformation particles of gold or tungsten are coated with DNA and then shot into young plant cells or plant embryos. Some genetic material will enter the cells and transform them. This method can be used on plants that are not susceptible to \"Agrobacterium\" infection and also allows transformation of plant plastids. Another transformation method for plant and animal cells is electroporation. Electroporation involves subjecting the plant or animal cell to an electric shock, which can make the cell membrane permeable to plasmid DNA. In some cases the electroporated cells will incorporate the DNA into their genome. Due to the damage caused to the cells and DNA the transformation efficiency of biolistics and electroporation is lower than agrobacterial mediated transformation and microinjection.\n\nAs often only a single cell is transformed with genetic material the organism must be regenerated from that single cell. As bacteria consist of a single cell and reproduce clonally regeneration is not necessary. In plants this is accomplished through the use of tissue culture. Each plant species has different requirements for successful regeneration through tissue culture. If successful an adult plant is produced that contains the transgene in every cell. In animals it is necessary to ensure that the inserted DNA is present in the embryonic stem cells. Selectable markers are used to easily differentiate transformed from untransformed cells. These markers are usually present in the transgenic organism, although a number of strategies have been developed that can remove the selectable marker from the mature transgenic plant. When the offspring is produced they can be screened for the presence of the gene. All offspring from the first generation will be heterozygous for the inserted gene and must be mated together to produce a homozygous animal.\n\nFurther testing uses PCR, Southern hybridization, and DNA sequencing is conducted to confirm that an organism contains the new gene. These tests can also confirm the chromosomal location and copy number of the inserted gene. The presence of the gene does not guarantee it will be expressed at appropriate levels in the target tissue so methods that look for and measure the gene products (RNA and protein) are also used. These include northern hybridization, quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, ELISA and phenotypic analysis. For stable transformation the gene should be passed to the offspring in a Mendelian inheritance pattern, so the organism's offspring are also studied.\n\nGenome editing is a type of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, replaced, or removed from a genome using artificially engineered nucleases, or \"molecular scissors.\" The nucleases create specific double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at desired locations in the genome, and harness the cellâs endogenous mechanisms to repair the induced break by natural processes of homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). There are currently four families of engineered nucleases: meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the Cas9-guideRNA system (adapted from the CRISPR prokarotic immune system). In contrast to artificial genome editing natural genome editing occurs through viral and sub-viral agents competent in identification of genetic syntax structures for insertion/deletion processes with the result of conserved selection processes.\n\nGenetic engineering has applications in medicine, research, industry and agriculture and can be used on a wide range of plants, animals and micro organisms.\n\nIn medicine, genetic engineering has been used in manufacturing drugs, to create model animals and do laboratory research, and in gene therapy.\n\nGenetic engineering is used to mass-produce insulin, human growth hormones, follistim (for treating infertility), human albumin, monoclonal antibodies, antihemophilic factors, vaccines and many other drugs. Mouse hybridomas, cells fused together to create monoclonal antibodies, have been humanised through genetic engineering to create human monoclonal antibodies. Genetically engineered viruses are being developed that can still confer immunity, but lack the infectious sequences.\n\nGenetic engineering is used to create animal models of human diseases. Genetically modified mice are the most common genetically engineered animal model. They have been used to study and model cancer (the oncomouse), obesity, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, substance abuse, anxiety, aging and Parkinson disease. Potential cures can be tested against these mouse models. Also genetically modified pigs have been bred with the aim of increasing the success of pig to human organ transplantation.\n\nGene therapy is the genetic engineering of humans, generally by replacing defective genes with effective ones. This can occur in somatic tissue or germline tissue.\n\nSomatic gene therapy has been studied in clinical research in several diseases, including X-linked SCID, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and Parkinson's disease. In 2012, Glybera became the first gene therapy treatment to be approved for clinical use in either Europe or the United States after its endorsement by the European Commission.\n\nWith regard to germline gene therapy, the scientific community has been opposed to attempts to alter genes in humans in inheritable ways using biotechnology since the technology was first introduced, and the caution has continued as the technology has progressed. With the advent of new techniques like CRISPR, in March 2015 scientists urged a worldwide ban on clinical use of gene editing technologies to edit the human genome in a way that can be inherited. In April 2015, Chinese researchers sparked controversy when they reported results of basic research experiments in which they edited the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR. In December 2015, scientists of major world academies called for a moratorium on inheritable human genome edits, including those related to CRISPR-Cas9 technologies.\n\nThere are also ethical concerns should the technology be used not just for treatment, but for enhancement, modification or alteration of a human beings' appearance, adaptability, intelligence, character or behavior. The distinction between cure and enhancement can also be difficult to establish. Transhumanists consider the enhancement of humans desirable.\n\nGenetic engineering is an important tool for natural scientists. Genes and other genetic information from a wide range of organisms are transformed into bacteria for storage and modification, creating genetically modified bacteria in the process. Bacteria are cheap, easy to grow, clonal, multiply quickly, relatively easy to transform and can be stored at -80Â Â°C almost indefinitely. Once a gene is isolated it can be stored inside the bacteria providing an unlimited supply for research.\n\nOrganisms are genetically engineered to discover the functions of certain genes. This could be the effect on the phenotype of the organism, where the gene is expressed or what other genes it interacts with. These experiments generally involve loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression.\n\n\nUsing genetic engineering techniques one can transform microorganisms such as bacteria or yeast, or transform cells from multicellular organisms such as insects or mammals, with a gene coding for a useful protein, such as an enzyme, so that the transformed organism will overexpress the desired protein. One can manufacture mass quantities of the protein by growing the transformed organism in bioreactor equipment using techniques of industrial fermentation, and then purifying the protein. Some genes do not work well in bacteria, so yeast, insect cells, or mammalians cells, each a eukaryote, can also be used. These techniques are used to produce medicines such as insulin, human growth hormone, and vaccines, supplements such as tryptophan, aid in the production of food (chymosin in cheese making) and fuels. Other applications involving genetically engineered bacteria being investigated involve making the bacteria perform tasks outside their natural cycle, such as making biofuels, cleaning up oil spills, carbon and other toxic waste and detecting arsenic in drinking water. Certain genetically modified microbes can also be used in biomining and bioremediation, due to their ability to extract heavy metals from their environment and incorporate them into compounds that are more easily recoverable.\n\nIn materials science, a genetically modified virus has been used in an academic lab as a scaffold for assembling a more environmentally friendly lithium-ion battery.\n\nBacteria have been engineered to function as sensors by expressing a fluorescent protein under certain environmental conditions.\n\nOne of the best-known and controversial applications of genetic engineering is the creation and use of genetically modified crops or genetically modified organisms, such as genetically modified fish, which are used to produce genetically modified food and materials with diverse uses. There are four main goals in generating genetically modified crops.\n\nOne goal, and the first to be realized commercially, is to provide protection from environmental threats, such as cold (in the case of Ice-minus bacteria), or pathogens, such as insects or viruses, and/or resistance to herbicides. There are also fungal and virus resistant crops developed or in development. They have been developed to make the insect and weed management of crops easier and can indirectly increase crop yield.\n\nAnother goal in generating GMOs is to modify the quality of produce by, for instance, increasing the nutritional value or providing more industrially useful qualities or quantities. The Amflora potato, for example, produces a more industrially useful blend of starches. Cows have been engineered to produce more protein in their milk to facilitate cheese production. Soybeans and canola have been genetically modified to produce more healthy oils.\n\nAnother goal consists of driving the GMO to produce materials that it does not normally make. One example is \"pharming\", which uses crops as bioreactors to produce vaccines, drug intermediates, or drug themselves; the useful product is purified from the harvest and then used in the standard pharmaceutical production process. Cows and goats have been engineered to express drugs and other proteins in their milk, and in 2009 the FDA approved a drug produced in goat milk.\n\nAnother goal in generating GMOs, is to directly improve yield by accelerating growth, or making the organism more hardy (for plants, by improving salt, cold or drought tolerance). Salmon have been genetically modified with growth hormones to increase their size.\n\nThe genetic engineering of agricultural crops can increase the growth rates and resistance to different diseases caused by pathogens and parasites. This is beneficial as it can greatly increase the production of food sources with the usage of fewer resources that would be required to host the world's growing populations. These modified crops would also reduce the usage of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, and therefore decrease the severity and frequency of the damages produced by these chemical pollution.\n\nThere is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation. Gene flow into related non-transgenic crops, off target effects on beneficial organisms and the impact on biodiversity are important environmental issues. Ethical concerns involve religious issues, corporate control of the food supply, intellectual property rights and the level of labeling needed on genetically modified products.\n\nGenetic engineering has potential applications in conservation and natural areas management. For example, gene transfer through viral vectors has been proposed as a means of controlling invasive species as well as vaccinating threatened fauna from disease. Transgenic trees have also been suggested as a way to confer resistance to pathogens in wild populations. With the increasing risks of maladaptation in organisms as a result of climate change and other perturbations, facilitated adaptation through gene tweaking could be one solution to reducing extinction risks. Applications of genetic engineering in conservation are thus far mostly theoretical and have yet to be put into practice. Further experimentation will be necessary to gauge the benefits and costs of such practices.\n\nGenetic engineering is also being used to create BioArt. Some bacteria have been genetically engineered to create black and white photographs.\n\nGenetic engineering has also been used to create novelty items such as lavender-colored carnations, blue roses, and glowing fish.\n\nThe regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of genetically modified crops. There are differences in the regulation of GM crops between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety. Starting in the late 1980s, guidance on assessing the safety of genetically engineered plants and food emerged from organizations including the FAO and WHO.\n\nCritics have objected to use of genetic engineering per se on several grounds, including ethical concerns, ecological concerns, and economic concerns raised by the fact GM techniques and GM organisms are subject to intellectual property law. GMOs also are involved in controversies over GM food with respect to whether food produced from GM crops is safe, whether it should be labeled, and whether GM crops are needed to address the world's food needs. See the genetically modified food controversies article for discussion of issues about GM crops and GM food. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, and protests, and to restrictive regulation of commercial products in some countries.\n\n\n", "id": "12383", "title": "Genetic engineering"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12384", "text": "Gettysburg Address\n\nThe Gettysburg Address is a speech by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, one of the best-known in American history. It was delivered by Lincoln during the American Civil War, on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863, at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, four and a half months after the Union armies defeated those of the Confederacy at the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nAbraham Lincoln's carefully crafted address, secondary to other presentations that day, was one of the greatest and most influential statements of national purpose. In just over two minutes, Lincoln reiterated the principles of human equality espoused by the Declaration of Independence and proclaimed the Civil War as a struggle for the preservation of the Union sundered by the secession crisis, with \"a new birth of freedom\" that would bring true equality to all of its citizens. Lincoln also redefined the Civil War as a struggle not just for the Union, but also for the principle of human equality.\n\nBeginning with the now-iconic phrase \"Four score and seven years ago\"âreferring to the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776âLincoln examined the founding principles of the United States as stated in the Declaration of Independence. In the context of the Civil War, Lincoln also memorialized the sacrifices of those who gave their lives at Gettysburg and extolled virtues for the listeners (and the nation) to ensure the survival of America's representative democracy: that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\"\n\nDespite the speech's prominent place in the history and popular culture of the United States, the exact wording and location of the speech are disputed. The five known manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address in Lincoln's hand differ in a number of details, and also differ from contemporary newspaper reprints of the speech. Modern scholarship locates the speakers' platform 40 yards (or more) away from the \"Traditional Site\" within Soldiers' National Cemetery at the Soldiers' National Monument and entirely within private, adjacent Evergreen Cemetery.\nFollowing the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1â3, 1863, reburial of Union soldiers from the Gettysburg Battlefield graves began on October 17. David Wills, of the committee for the November 19 Consecration of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg, invited President Lincoln: \"It is the desire that, after the Oration, you, as Chief Executive of the nation, formally set apart these grounds to their sacred use by a few appropriate remarks.\" Lincoln's address followed the oration by Edward Everett, who subsequently included a copy of the Gettysburg Address in his 1864 book about the event (\"Address of the Hon. Edward Everett At the Consecration of the National Cemetery At Gettysburg, 19th November 1863, with the Dedicatory Speech of President Lincoln, and the Other Exercises of the Occasion; Accompanied by An Account of the Origin of the Undertaking and of the Arrangement of the Cemetery Grounds, and by a Map of the Battle-field and a Plan of the Cemetery\").\n\nDuring the train trip from Washington, D.C., to Gettysburg on November 18, Lincoln remarked to John Hay that he felt weak. On the morning of November 19, Lincoln mentioned to John Nicolay that he was dizzy. In the railroad car the President rode with his secretary, John G. Nicolay, his assistant secretary, John Hay, the three members of his Cabinet who accompanied him, William Seward, John Usher and Montgomery Blair, several foreign officials and others. Hay noted that during the speech Lincoln's face had 'a ghastly color' and that he was 'sad, mournful, almost haggard.' After the speech, when Lincoln boarded the 6:30 pm train for Washington, D.C., he was feverish and weak, with a severe headache. A protracted illness followed, which included a vesicular rash and was diagnosed as a mild case of smallpox. It thus seems highly likely that Lincoln was in the prodromal period of smallpox when he delivered the Gettysburg address.\n\nThe program organized for that day by Wills and his committee included:\nMusic, by Birgfeld's Band (\"Homage d'uns Heros\" by Adolph Birgfeld)\nPrayer, by Reverend T. H. Stockton, D.D.\nMusic, by the Marine Band (\"Old Hundred\"), directed by Francis Scala\nOration, by Hon. Edward Everett (\"The Battles of Gettysburg\")\nMusic, Hymn (\"Consecration Chant\") by B. B. French, Esq., music by Wilson G Horner, sung by Baltimore Glee Club\nDedicatory Remarks, by the President of the United States\nDirge (\"Oh! It is Great for Our Country to Die\", words by James G. Percival, music by Alfred Delaney), sung by Choir selected for the occasion\nBenediction, by Reverend H. L. Baugher, D.D.\n\nWhile it is Lincoln's short speech that has gone down in history as one of the finest examples of English public oratory, it was Everett's two-hour oration that was slated to be the \"Gettysburg address\" that day. His now seldom-read 13,607-word oration began:\n\nStanding beneath this serene sky, overlooking these broad fields now reposing from the labors of the waning year, the mighty Alleghenies dimly towering before us, the graves of our brethren beneath our feet, it is with hesitation that I raise my poor voice to break the eloquent silence of God and Nature. But the duty to which you have called me must be performed;âgrant me, I pray you, your indulgence and your sympathy.\n\nAnd ended two hours later with:\n\nBut they, I am sure, will join us in saying, as we bid farewell to the dust of these martyr-heroes, that wheresoever throughout the civilized world the accounts of this great warfare are read, and down to the latest period of recorded time, in the glorious annals of our common country, there will be no brighter page than that which relates the Battles of Gettysburg.\n\nLengthy dedication addresses like Everett's were common at cemeteries in this era. The tradition began in 1831 when Justice Joseph Story delivered the dedication address at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Those addresses often linked cemeteries to the mission of Union.\n\nShortly after Everett's well-received remarks, Lincoln spoke for only a few minutes. With a \"few appropriate remarks\", he was able to summarize his view of the war in just ten sentences.\n\nDespite the historical significance of Lincoln's speech, modern scholars disagree as to its exact wording, and contemporary transcriptions published in newspaper accounts of the event and even handwritten copies by Lincoln himself differ in their wording, punctuation, and structure. Of these versions, the Bliss version, written well after the speech as a favor for a friend, is viewed by many as the standard text. Its text differs, however, from the written versions prepared by Lincoln before and after his speech. It is the only version to which Lincoln affixed his signature, and the last he is known to have written.\n\nIn \"Lincoln at Gettysburg\", Garry Wills notes the parallels between Lincoln's speech and Pericles's Funeral Oration during the Peloponnesian War as described by Thucydides. (James McPherson notes this connection in his review of Wills's book. Gore Vidal also draws attention to this link in a BBC documentary about oration.) Pericles' speech, like Lincoln's: \nIn contrast, writer Adam Gopnik, in \"The New Yorker\", notes that while Everett's Oration was explicitly neoclassical, referring directly to Marathon and Pericles, \"Lincoln's rhetoric is, instead, deliberately Biblical. (It is difficult to find a single obviously classical reference in any of his speeches.) Lincoln had mastered the sound of the King James Bible so completely that he could recast abstract issues of constitutional law in Biblical terms, making the proposition that Texas and New Hampshire should be forever bound by a single post office sound like something right out of Genesis.\"\n\nSeveral theories have been advanced by Lincoln scholars to explain the provenance of Lincoln's famous phrase \"government of the people, by the people, for the people\".\n\nThe Prologue to John Wycliffe's first English translation of the Bible, which first appeared in 1384, includes the phrase: \n\nIn a discussion \"A more probable origin of a famous Lincoln phrase\", in \"The American Monthly Review of Reviews\", Albert Shaw credits a correspondent with pointing out the writings of William Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, who wrote in the 1888 work \"Abraham Lincoln: The True Story of A Great Life\" that he had brought to Lincoln some of the sermons of abolitionist minister Theodore Parker, of Massachusetts, and that Lincoln was moved by Parker's use of this idea:\n\nCraig R. Smith, in \"Criticism of Political Rhetoric and Disciplinary Integrity\", suggested Lincoln's view of the government as expressed in the Gettysburg Address was influenced by the noted speech of Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster, the \"Second Reply to Hayne\", in which Webster famously thundered \"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!\" Specifically, in this speech on January 26, 1830, before the United States Senate, Webster described the federal government as: \"made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people\", foreshadowing Lincoln's \"government of the people, by the people, for the people\". Webster also noted, \"This government, Sir, is the independent offspring of the popular will. It is not the creature of State legislatures; nay, more, if the whole truth must be told, the people brought it into existence, established it, and have hitherto supported it, for the very purpose, amongst others, of imposing certain salutary restraints on State sovereignties.\"\n\nA source predating these others with which Lincoln was certainly familiar was Chief Justice John Marshall's opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), a case asserting federal authority to create a national bank and to be free from the State's powers to tax. In asserting the superiority of federal power over the states, Chief Justice Marshall stated: \"The government of the Union, then (whatever may be the influence of this fact on the case), is, emphatically and truly, a government of the people. In form, and in substance, it emanates from them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their benefit.\" Lincoln, a lawyer and President engaged in the greatest struggle of federalism, was (more eloquently) echoing the preeminent case that had solidified federal power over the States.\n\nWills observed Lincoln's usage of the imagery of birth, life, and death in reference to a nation \"brought forth\", \"conceived\", and that shall not \"perish\". Others, including Allen C. Guelzo, the director of Civil War Era studies at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, suggested that Lincoln's formulation \"four score and seven\" was an allusion to the King James Version of the Bible's , in which man's lifespan is given as \"threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years\".\n\nEach of the five known manuscript copies of the Gettysburg Address is named for the person who received it from Lincoln. Lincoln gave copies to his private secretaries, John Nicolay and John Hay. Both of these drafts were written around the time of his November 19 address, while the other three copies of the address, the Everett, Bancroft, and Bliss copies, were written by Lincoln for charitable purposes well after November 19. In part because Lincoln provided a title and signed and dated the Bliss copy, it has become the standard text of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.\n\nNicolay and Hay were appointed custodians of Lincoln's papers by Lincoln's son Robert Todd Lincoln in 1874. After appearing in facsimile in an article written by John Nicolay in 1894, the Nicolay copy was presumably among the papers passed to Hay by Nicolay's daughter Helen upon Nicolay's death in 1901. Robert Lincoln began a search for the original copy in 1908, which resulted in the discovery of a handwritten copy of the Gettysburg Address among the bound papers of John Hayâa copy now known as the \"Hay copy\" or \"Hay draft\".\n\nThe Hay draft differed from the version of the Gettysburg Address published by John Nicolay in 1894 in a number of significant ways: it was written on a different type of paper, had a different number of words per line and number of lines, and contained editorial revisions in Lincoln's hand.\n\nBoth the Hay and Nicolay copies of the Address are within the Library of Congress, encased in specially designed, temperature-controlled, sealed containers with argon gas in order to protect the documents from oxidation and continued deterioration.\n\nThe Nicolay copy is often called the \"first draft\" because it is believed to be the earliest copy that exists. Scholars disagree over whether the Nicolay copy was actually the reading copy Lincoln held at Gettysburg on November 19. In an 1894 article that included a facsimile of this copy, Nicolay, who had become the custodian of Lincoln's papers, wrote that Lincoln had brought to Gettysburg the first part of the speech written in ink on Executive Mansion stationery, and that he had written the second page in pencil on lined paper before the dedication on November 19. Matching folds are still evident on the two pages, suggesting it could be the copy that eyewitnesses say Lincoln took from his coat pocket and read at the ceremony. Others believe that the delivery text has been lost, because some of the words and phrases of the Nicolay copy do not match contemporary transcriptions of Lincoln's original speech. The words \"under God\", for example, are missing in this copy from the phrase \"that this nation shall have a new birth of freedomÂ ...\" In order for the Nicolay draft to have been the reading copy, either the contemporary transcriptions were inaccurate, or Lincoln would have had to depart from his written text in several instances. This copy of the Gettysburg Address apparently remained in John Nicolay's possession until his death in 1901, when it passed to his friend and colleague John Hay. It used to be on display as part of the American Treasures exhibition of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe existence of the Hay copy was first announced to the public in 1906, after the search for the \"original manuscript\" of the Address among the papers of John Hay brought it to light. Significantly, it differs somewhat from the manuscript of the Address described by John Nicolay in his article, and contains numerous omissions and inserts in Lincoln's own hand, including omissions critical to the basic meaning of the sentence, not simply words that would be added by Lincoln to strengthen or clarify their meaning. In this copy, as in the Nicolay copy, the words \"under God\" are not present.\n\nThis version has been described as \"the most inexplicable\" of the drafts and is sometimes referred to as the \"second draft\". The \"Hay copy\" was made either on the morning of the delivery of the Address, or shortly after Lincoln's return to Washington. Those who believe that it was completed on the morning of his address point to the fact that it contains certain phrases that are not in the first draft but are in the reports of the address as delivered and in subsequent copies made by Lincoln. It is probable, they conclude, that, as stated in the explanatory note accompanying the original copies of the first and second drafts in the Library of Congress, Lincoln held this second draft when he delivered the address. Lincoln eventually gave this copy to his other personal secretary, John Hay, whose descendants donated both it and the Nicolay copy to the Library of Congress in 1916.\n\nThe Everett copy, also known as the \"Everett-Keyes copy\", was sent by President Lincoln to Edward Everett in early 1864, at Everett's request. Everett was collecting the speeches at the Gettysburg dedication into one bound volume to sell for the benefit of stricken soldiers at New York's Sanitary Commission Fair. The draft Lincoln sent became the third autograph copy, and is now in the possession of the Illinois State Historical Library in Springfield, Illinois, where it is currently on display in the Treasures Gallery of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum.\n\nThe Bancroft copy of the Gettysburg Address was written out by President Lincoln in February 1864 at the request of George Bancroft, the famed historian and former Secretary of the Navy, whose comprehensive ten-volume \"History of the United States\" later led him to be known as the \"father of American History\". Bancroft planned to include this copy in \"Autograph Leaves of Our Country's Authors\", which he planned to sell at a Soldiers' and Sailors' Sanitary Fair in Baltimore. As this fourth copy was written on both sides of the paper, it proved unusable for this purpose, and Bancroft was allowed to keep it. This manuscript is the only one accompanied both by a letter from Lincoln transmitting the manuscript and by the original envelope addressed and franked by Lincoln. This copy remained in the Bancroft family for many years, was sold to various dealers and purchased by Nicholas and Marguerite Lilly Noyes, who donated the manuscript to Cornell in 1949. It is now held by the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections in the Carl A. Kroch Library at Cornell University. It is the only one of the five copies to be privately owned.\n\nDiscovering that his fourth written copy could not be used, Lincoln then wrote a fifth draft, which was accepted for the purpose requested. The Bliss copy, named for Colonel Alexander Bliss, Bancroft's stepson and publisher of \"Autograph Leaves\", is the only draft to which Lincoln affixed his signature. Lincoln is not known to have made any further copies of the Gettysburg Address. Because of the apparent care in its preparation, and in part because Lincoln provided a title and signed and dated this copy, it has become the standard version of the address and the source for most facsimile reproductions of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. It is the version that is inscribed on the South wall of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nThis draft is now displayed in the Lincoln Room of the White House, a gift of Oscar B. Cintas, former Cuban Ambassador to the United States. Cintas, a wealthy collector of art and manuscripts, purchased the Bliss copy at a public auction in 1949 for $54,000 ($ as of 2017), at that time the highest price ever paid for a document at public auction. Cintas' properties were claimed by the Castro government after the Cuban Revolution in 1959, but Cintas, who died in 1957, willed the Gettysburg Address to the American people, provided it would be kept at the White House, where it was transferred in 1959.\n\nGarry Wills concluded the Bliss copy \"is stylistically preferable to others in one significant way: Lincoln removed 'here' from 'that cause for which they (here) gaveÂ ...' The seventh 'here' is in all other versions of the speech.\" Wills noted the fact that Lincoln \"was still making such improvements\", suggesting Lincoln was more concerned with a perfected text than with an 'original' one.\n\nFrom November 21, 2008, to January 1, 2009, the Albert H. Small Documents Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History hosted a limited public viewing of the Bliss copy, with the support of then-First Lady Laura Bush. The Museum also launched an online exhibition and interactive gallery to enable visitors to look more closely at the document.\n\nAnother contemporary source of the text is the Associated Press dispatch, transcribed from the shorthand notes taken by reporter Joseph L. Gilbert. It also differs from the drafted text in a number of minor ways.\n\nEyewitness reports vary as to their view of Lincoln's performance. In 1931, the printed recollections of 87-year-old Mrs. Sarah A. Cooke Myers, who was 19 when she attended the ceremony, suggest a dignified silence followed Lincoln's speech: \"I was close to the President and heard all of the Address, but it seemed short. Then there was an impressive silence like our Menallen Friends Meeting. There was no applause when he stopped speaking.\" According to historian Shelby Foote, after Lincoln's presentation, the applause was delayed, scattered, and \"barely polite\". In contrast, Pennsylvania Governor Curtin maintained, \"He pronounced that speech in a voice that all the multitude heard. The crowd was hushed into silence because the President stood before themÂ ... It was so Impressive! It was the common remark of everybody. Such a speech, as they said it was!\" Reinterment of soldiers' remains from field graves into the cemetery, which had begun within months of the battle, was less than half complete on the day of the ceremony.\n\nIn an oft-repeated legend, Lincoln is said to have turned to his bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon and remarked that his speech, like a bad plow, \"won't scour\". According to Garry Wills, this statement has no basis in fact and largely originates from the unreliable recollections of Lamon. In Garry Wills's view, \" had done what he wanted to do \".\n\nIn a letter to Lincoln written the following day, Everett praised the President for his eloquent and concise speech, saying, \"I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes.\" Lincoln replied that he was glad to know the speech was not a \"total failure\".\n\nOther public reaction to the speech was divided along partisan lines. The Democratic-leaning \"Chicago Times\" observed, \"The cheek of every American must tingle with shame as he reads the silly, flat and dishwatery utterances of the man who has to be pointed out to intelligent foreigners as the President of the United States.\" In contrast, the Republican-leaning \"New York Times\" was complimentary and printed the speech. In Massachusetts, the \"Springfield Republican\" also printed the entire speech, calling it \"a perfect gem\" that was \"deep in feeling, compact in thought and expression, and tasteful and elegant in every word and comma\". The \"Republican\" predicted that Lincoln's brief remarks would \"repay further study as the model speech\". On the sesquicentennial of the address, \"The Patriot-News\" of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, formerly the \"Patriot & Union\", retracted its original reaction (\"silly remarks\" deserving \"the veil of oblivion\") stating: \"Seven score and ten years ago, the forefathers of this media institution brought forth to its audience a judgment so flawed, so tainted by hubris, so lacking in the perspective history would bring, that it cannot remain unaddressed in our archives.Â ... the \"Patriot & Union\" failed to recognize [the speech's] momentous importance, timeless eloquence, and lasting significance. The \"Patriot-News\" regrets the error.\"\n\nForeign newspapers also criticized Lincoln's remarks. \"The Times\" of London commented: \"The ceremony [at Gettysburg] was rendered ludicrous by some of the luckless sallies of that poor President Lincoln.\"\n\nCongressman Joseph A. Goulden, then an eighteen-year-old school teacher, was present and heard the speech. He served in the United States Marine Corps during the war, and later had a successful career in insurance in Pennsylvania and New York City before entering Congress as a Democrat. In his later life, Goulden was often asked about the speech, since the passage of time made him one of a dwindling number of individuals who had been present for it. He commented on the event and Lincoln's speech in favorable terms, naming Lincoln's address as one of the inspirations for him to enter military service. Goulden's recollections included remarks to the House of Representatives in 1914.\n\nWilliam R. Rathvon is the only known eyewitness of both Lincoln's arrival at Gettysburg and the address itself to have left an audio recording of his recollections. One year before his death in 1939, Rathvon's reminiscences were recorded on February 12, 1938, at the Boston studios of radio station WRUL, including his reading the address, itself, and a 78Â rpm record was pressed. The title of the 78 record was \"I Heard Lincoln That Day â William R. Rathvon, TR Productions\". A copy wound up at National Public Radio (NPR) during a \"Quest for Sound\" project in 1999. NPR continues to air it around Lincoln's birthday.\n\nLike most people who came to Gettysburg, the Rathvon family was aware that Lincoln was going to make some remarks. The family went to the town square where the procession was to form to go out to the cemetery that had not been completed yet. At the head of the procession rode Lincoln on a gray horse preceded by a military band that was the first the young boy had ever seen. Rathvon describes Lincoln as so tall and with such long legs that they went almost to the ground; he also mentions the long eloquent speech given by Edward Everett of Massachusetts whom Rathvon accurately described as the \"most finished orator of the day\". Rathvon then goes on to describe how Lincoln stepped forward and \"with a manner serious almost to sadness, gave his brief address\". During the delivery, along with some other boys, young Rathvon wiggled his way forward through the crowd until he stood within 15 feet of Mr. Lincoln and looked up into what he described as Lincoln's \"serious face\". Rathvon recalls candidly that, although he listened \"intently to every word the president uttered and heard it clearly\", he explains, \"boylike, I could not recall any of it afterwards\". But he explains that if anyone said anything disparaging about \"honest Abe\", there would have been a \"junior battle of Gettysburg\". In the recording Rathvon speaks of Lincoln's speech allegorically \"echoing through the hills\".\n\nThe only known and confirmed photograph of Lincoln at Gettysburg, taken by photographer David Bachrach was identified in the Mathew Brady collection of photographic plates in the National Archives and Records Administration in 1952. While Lincoln's speech was short and may have precluded multiple pictures of him while speaking, he and the other dignitaries sat for hours during the rest of the program. Given the length of Everett's speech and the length of time it took for 19th-century photographers to get \"set up\" before taking a picture, it is quite plausible that the photographers were ill-prepared for the brevity of Lincoln's remarks.\n\nThe words \"under God\" do not appear in the Nicolay and Hay drafts but are included in the three later copies (Everett, Bancroft, and Bliss). Accordingly, some skeptics maintain that Lincoln did not utter the words \"under God\" at Gettysburg. However, at least three reporters telegraphed the text of Lincoln's speech on the day the Address was given with the words \"under God\" included. Historian William E. Barton argues that:\n\nThe reporters present included Joseph Gilbert, from the Associated Press; Charles Hale, from the \"Boston Advertiser\"; John R. Young (who later became the Librarian of Congress), from the \"Philadelphia Press\"; and reporters from the \"Cincinnati Commercial\", \"New York Tribune\", and \"The New York Times\". Charles Hale \"had notebook and pencil in hand, [and] took down the slow-spoken words of the President\". \"He took down what he declared was the exact language of Lincoln's address, and his declaration was as good as the oath of a court stenographer. His associates confirmed his testimony, which was received, as it deserved to be, at its face value.\" One explanation is that Lincoln deviated from his prepared text and inserted the phrase when he spoke. Ronald C. White, visiting professor of history at the University of California â Los Angeles and professor of American religious history emeritus at the San Francisco Theological Seminary, wrote in this context of Lincoln's insertion and usage of \"under God\":\n\nIt was an uncharacteristically spontaneous revision for a speaker who did not trust extemporaneous speech. Lincoln had added impromptu words in several earlier speeches, but always offered a subsequent apology for the change. In this instance, he did not. And Lincoln included \"under God\" in all three copies of the address he prepared at later dates. \"Under God\" pointed backward and forward: back to \"this nation\", which drew its breath from both political and religious sources, but also forward to a \"new birth\". Lincoln had come to see the Civil War as a ritual of purification. The old Union had to die. The old man had to die. Death became a transition to a new Union and a new humanity.\n\nThe phrase \"under God\" was used frequently in works published before 1860, usually with the meaning \"with God's help\".\n\nOutside the Cemetery and within sight of the cross-walk, a historical marker proclaims:\n\nNearby, Nov. 19, 1863, in dedicating the National Cemetery, Abraham Lincoln gave the address which he had written in Washington and revised after his arrival at Gettysburg the evening of November 18.\n\nDirectly inside the Taneytown Road entrance are located the Rostrum and the \"Lincoln Address Memorial.\" Neither of these is located within 300 yards of any of the five (or more) claimed locations for the dedicatory platform.\n\nColonel W. Yates Selleck was a marshal in the parade on Consecration Day and was seated on the platform when Lincoln made the address. Selleck marked a map with the position of the platform and described it as \"350 feet almost due north of Soldiers' National Monument, 40 feet from a point in the outer circle of lots where [the] Michigan and New York [burial sections] are separated by a path\". A location which approximates this description is 39Â°49.243â²N, 77Â°13.869â²W.\n\nAs pointed out in 1973 by retired park historian Frederick Tilberg, the \"Selleck Site\" is 25 feet lower than the crest of Cemetery Hill, and only the crest presents a panoramic view of the battlefield. A spectacular view from the location of the speech was noted by many eyewitnesses, is consistent with the \"Traditional Site\" at the Soldiers' National Monument (and other sites on the crest) but is inconsistent with the \"Selleck Site.\"\n\nThe \"Kentucky Memorial\" was erected in 1975, is located directly adjacent to the Soldiers' National Monument, and states, \"Kentucky honors her son, Abraham Lincoln, who delivered his immortal address at the site now marked by the soldiers' monument.\" With its position at the center of the concentric rings of soldiers' graves and the continuing endorsement of Lincoln's native state the Soldiers' National Monument persists as a credible location for the speech.\n\nWriting a physical description of the layout for the Gettysburg National Cemetery under construction in November 1863, the correspondent from the \"Cincinnati Daily Commercial\" described the dividing lines between the state grave plots as \"the radii of a common center, where a flag pole is now raised, but where it is proposed to erect a national monument\". With the inclusion of this quotation Tilberg inadvertently verifies a central principle of future photographic analysesâa flagpole, rather than the speakers' platform, occupied the central point of the soldiers' graves. In fact, the precision of the photo-analyses relies upon the coincidence of position between this temporary flag pole and the future monument.\n\nConfusing to today's tourist, the \"Kentucky Memorial\" is contradicted by a newer marker which was erected nearby by the Gettysburg National Military Park and locates the speakers' platform inside Evergreen Cemetery. Similarly, outdated National Park Service documents which pinpoint the location at the Soldiers' National Monument have not been systematically revised since the placement of the newer marker. Miscellaneous web pages perpetuate the \"Traditional Site.\"\n\nBased upon photographic analysis, the Gettysburg National Military Park (G.N.M.P.) placed a marker (near ) which states, \"The speakers' platform was located in Evergreen Cemetery to your left.\" The observer of this marker stands facing the fence which separates the two cemeteries (one public and one private).\n\nIn 1982, Senior Park Historian Kathleen Georg Harrison first analyzed photographs and proposed a location in Evergreen Cemetery but has not published her analysis. Speaking for Harrison without revealing details, two sources characterize her proposed location as \"on or near [the] Brown family vault\" in Evergreen Cemetery.\n\nWilliam A. Frassanito, a former military intelligence analyst, documented a comprehensive photographic analysis in 1995, and it associates the location of the platform with the position of specific modern headstones in Evergreen Cemetery. According to Frassanito, the extant graves of Israel Yount (died 1892)(), John Koch (died 1913)(), and George E. Kitzmiller (died 1874)() are among those which occupy the location of the 1863 speaker's stand.\n\nAssistant Professor of New Media at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, Christopher Oakley and his students are \"working to produce a lifelike virtual 3-D re-creation of Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg Address\" as part of the \"Virtual Lincoln Project.\" After taking precise measurements, some using lasers, and countless photographs on Cemetery Hill in 2013, Oakley's team used 3-D animation software Maya to estimate locations for the platform and the photographers who recorded its occupants. This work remains under development.\n\nThe GNMP marker, Wills' interpretation of Harrison's analysis, and the Frassanito analysis concur that the platform was located in private Evergreen Cemetery, rather than public Soldiers' National Cemetery. The National Park Service's \"National Cemetery Walking Tour\" brochure is one NPS document which agrees:\nThe Soldiers' National Monument, long misidentified as the spot from which Lincoln spoke, honors the fallen soldiers. [The location of the speech] was actually on the crown of this hill, a short distance on the other side of the iron fence and inside the Evergreen Cemetery, where President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address to a crowd of some 15,000 people.\n\nWhile the GNMP marker is unspecific, providing only \"to your left\", the locations determined by the Harrison/Wills analysis and the Frassanito analysis differ by 40 yards. Frassanito has documented 1) his own conclusion, 2) his own\nmethods and 3) a refutation of the Harrison site, but neither the GNMP nor Harrison has provided any documentation. Each of the three points to a location in Evergreen Cemetery, as do modern NPS publications.\n\nAlthough Lincoln dedicated the Gettysburg National Cemetery, the monument at the Cemetery's center actually has nothing to do with Lincoln or his famous speech. Intended to symbolize Columbia paying tribute to her fallen sons, its appreciation has been commandeered by the thirst for a tidy home for the speech. Freeing the Cemetery and Monument to serve their original purpose, honoring of Union departed, is as unlikely as a resolution to the location controversy and the erection of a public monument to the speech in the exclusively private Evergreen Cemetery.\n\nThe importance of the Gettysburg Address in the history of the United States is underscored by its enduring presence in American culture. In addition to its prominent place carved into a stone cella on the south wall of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the Gettysburg Address is frequently referred to in works of popular culture, with the implicit expectation that contemporary audiences will be familiar with Lincoln's words.\n\nIn the many generations that have passed since the Address, it has remained among the most famous speeches in American history, and is often taught in classes about history or civics. Lincoln's Gettysburg Address is itself referenced in another of those famed orations, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. Standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in August 1963, King began with a reference, by the style of his opening phrase, to President Lincoln and his enduring words: \"Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice.\"\n\nPhrases from the Address are often used or referenced in other works. The current Constitution of France states that the principle of the Republic of France is \"\"gouvernement du peuple, par le peuple et pour le peuple\" (\"government of the people, by the people, and for the people\"), a literal translation of Lincoln's words. Sun Yat-Sen's \"Three Principles of the People\" were inspired from that phrase as well. The aircraft carrier has as its ship's motto the phrase \"shall not perish\".\n\nU.S. Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts wrote of the address and its enduring presence in American culture after Lincoln's assassination in April 1865: \"That speech, uttered at the field of GettysburgÂ ... and now sanctified by the martyrdom of its author, is a monumental act. In the modesty of his nature he said 'the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here; but it can never forget what they did here.' He was mistaken. The world at once noted what he said, and will never cease to remember it.\"\n\nU.S. President John F. Kennedy stated in July 1963 about the battle and Lincoln's speech: \"Five score years ago the ground on which we here stand shuddered under the clash of arms and was consecrated for all time by the blood of American manhood. Abraham Lincoln, in dedicating this great battlefield, has expressed, in words too eloquent for paraphrase or summary, why this sacrifice was necessary.\" Sadly, Kennedy would meet the same fate as Abraham Lincoln only three days after the Gettysburg Address centennial.\n\nIn 2015, the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation compiled \"Gettysburg Replies: The World Responds to Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address\". The work challenges leaders to craft 272 word responses to celebrate Abraham Lincoln, the Gettysburg Address, or a related topic.\nOne of the replies was by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson in which he made the point that one of Lincoln's greatest legacies was establishing, in the same year of the Gettysburg Address, the National Academy of Sciences, which had the longterm effect of \"setting our Nation on a course of scientifically enlightened governance, without which we all may perish from this Earth\".\n\n\n\n", "id": "12384", "title": "Gettysburg Address"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12385", "text": "Genetic code\n\nThe genetic code is the set of rules by which information encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links amino acids in an order specified by mRNA, using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.\n\nThe code defines how sequences of nucleotide triplets, called \"codons\", specify which amino acid will be added next during protein synthesis. With some exceptions, a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. Because the vast majority of genes are encoded with exactly the same code (see the RNA codon table), this particular code is often referred to as the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply \"the\" genetic code, though in fact some variant codes have evolved. For example, protein synthesis in human mitochondria relies on a genetic code that differs from the standard genetic code.\n\nWhile the \"genetic code\" determines a protein's amino acid sequence, other genomic regions determine when and where these proteins are produced according to a multitude of more complex \"gene regulatory codes\".\n\nSerious efforts to understand how proteins are encoded began after the structure of DNA was discovered in 1953. George Gamow postulated that sets of three bases must be employed to encode the 20 standard amino acids used by living cells to build proteins. With four different nucleotides, a code of 2 nucleotides would allow for only a maximum of 16 amino acids. A code of 3 nucleotides could code for a maximum of 64 amino acids.\n\nThe Crick, Brenner et al. experiment first demonstrated that codons consist of three DNA bases; Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich J. Matthaei were the first to elucidate the nature of a codon in 1961 at the National Institutes of Health. They used a cell-free system to translate a poly-uracil RNA sequence (i.e., UUUUU...) and discovered that the polypeptide that they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid phenylalanine. They thereby deduced that the codon UUU specified the amino acid phenylalanine. This was followed by experiments in Severo Ochoa's laboratory that demonstrated that the poly-adenine RNA sequence (AAAAA...) coded for the polypeptide poly-lysine and that the poly-cytosine RNA sequence (CCCCC...) coded for the polypeptide poly-proline. Therefore, the codon AAA specified the amino acid lysine, and the codon CCC specified the amino acid proline. Using different copolymers most of the remaining codons were then determined. Subsequent work by Har Gobind Khorana identified the rest of the genetic code. Shortly thereafter, Robert W. Holley determined the structure of transfer RNA (tRNA), the adapter molecule that facilitates the process of translating RNA into protein. This work was based upon earlier studies by Severo Ochoa, who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for his work on the enzymology of RNA synthesis.\n\nExtending this work, Nirenberg and Philip Leder revealed the triplet nature of the genetic code and deciphered the codons of the standard genetic code. In these experiments, various combinations of mRNA were passed through a filter that contained ribosomes, the components of cells that translate RNA into protein. Unique triplets promoted the binding of specific tRNAs to the ribosome. Leder and Nirenberg were able to determine the sequences of 54 out of 64 codons in their experiments. In 1968, Khorana, Holley and Nirenberg received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work.\n\nA codon is defined by the initial nucleotide from which translation starts and sets the frame for a run of uninterrupted triplets, which is known as an \"open reading frame\" (ORF). For example, the string GGGAAACCC, if read from the first position, contains the codons GGG, AAA, and CCC; and, if read from the second position, it contains the codons GGA and AAC; if read starting from the third position, GAA and ACC. Every sequence can, thus, be read in its 5' â 3' direction in three reading frames, each of which will produce a different amino acid sequence (in the given example, Gly-Lys-Pro, Gly-Asn, or Glu-Thr, respectively). With double-stranded DNA, there are six possible reading frames, three in the forward orientation on one strand and three reverse on the opposite strand. The actual frame from which a protein sequence is translated is defined by a start codon, usually the first AUG codon in the mRNA sequence.\n\nIn eukaryotes, ORFs in exons are often interrupted by introns.\n\nTranslation starts with a chain initiation codon or start codon. Unlike stop codons, the codon alone is not sufficient to begin the process. Nearby sequences such as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in \"E. coli\" and initiation factors are also required to start translation. The most common start codon is AUG, which is read as methionine or, in bacteria, as formylmethionine. Alternative start codons depending on the organism include \"GUG\" or \"UUG\"; these codons normally represent valine and leucine, respectively, but as start codons they are translated as methionine or formylmethionine.\n\nThe three stop codons have been given names: UAG is \"amber\", UGA is \"opal\" (sometimes also called \"umber\"), and UAA is \"ochre\". \"Amber\" was named by discoverers Richard Epstein and Charles Steinberg after their friend Harris Bernstein, whose last name means \"amber\" in German. The other two stop codons were named \"ochre\" and \"opal\" in order to keep the \"color names\" theme. Stop codons are also called \"termination\" or \"nonsense\" codons. They signal release of the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome because there is no cognate tRNA that has anticodons complementary to these stop signals, and so a release factor binds to the ribosome instead.\n\nDuring the process of DNA replication, errors occasionally occur in the polymerization of the second strand. These errors, called mutations, can affect the phenotype of an organism, especially if they occur within the protein coding sequence of a gene. Error rates are usually very lowâ1 error in every 10â100Â million basesâdue to the \"proofreading\" ability of DNA polymerases.\n\nMissense mutations and nonsense mutations are examples of point mutations, which can cause genetic diseases such as sickle-cell disease and thalassemia respectively. Clinically important missense mutations generally change the properties of the coded amino acid residue between being basic, acidic, polar or non-polar, whereas nonsense mutations result in a stop codon.\n\nMutations that disrupt the reading frame sequence by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases are known as frameshift mutations. These mutations usually result in a completely different translation from the original, and are also very likely to cause a stop codon to be read, which truncates the creation of the protein. These mutations may impair the function of the resulting protein, and are thus rare in \"in vivo\" protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of frameshift mutations is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before the organism is viable. Frameshift mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nAlthough most mutations that change protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have a beneficial effect on an organism. These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation will tend to become more common in a population through natural selection. Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage, since these viruses will evolve constantly and rapidly, and thus evade the defensive responses of e.g. the human immune system. In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, \"E. coli\", multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. This phenomenon is called clonal interference and causes competition among the mutations.\n\nDegeneracy is the redundancy of the genetic code. This term was given by Bernfield and Nirenberg. The genetic code has redundancy but no ambiguity (see the codon tables below for the full correlation). For example, although codons GAA and GAG both specify glutamic acid (redundancy), neither of them specifies any other amino acid (no ambiguity). The codons encoding one amino acid may differ in any of their three positions. For example, the amino acid leucine is specified by YUR or CUN (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, or CUG) codons (difference in the first or third position indicated using IUPAC notation), while the amino acid serine is specified by UCN or AGY (UCA, UCG, UCC, UCU, AGU, or AGC) codons (difference in the first, second, or third position). A practical consequence of redundancy is that errors in the third position of the triplet codon cause only a silent mutation or an error that would not affect the protein because the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity is maintained by equivalent substitution of amino acids; for example, a codon of NUN (where N = any nucleotide) tends to code for hydrophobic amino acids. NCN yields amino acid residues that are small in size and moderate in hydropathy; NAN encodes average size hydrophilic residues. The genetic code is so well-structured for hydropathy that a mathematical analysis (Singular Value Decomposition) of 12 variables (4 nucleotides x 3 positions) yields a remarkable correlation (C = 0.95) for predicting the hydropathy of the encoded amino acid directly from the triplet nucleotide sequence, \"without translation.\" Note in the table, below, eight amino acids are not affected at all by mutations at the third position of the codon, whereas in the figure above, a mutation at the second position is likely to cause a radical change in the physicochemical properties of the encoded amino acid.\nThe frequency of codons, also known as codon usage bias, can vary from species to species with functional implications for the control of translation. The following codon usage table is for the human genome.\n\nWhile slight variations on the standard code had been predicted earlier, none were discovered until 1979, when researchers studying human mitochondrial genes discovered they used an alternative code.\nMany slight variants have been discovered since then, including various alternative mitochondrial codes, and small variants such as translation of the codon UGA as tryptophan in \"Mycoplasma\" species, and translation of CUG as a serine rather than a leucine in yeasts of the \"CTG clade\" (\"Candida albicans\" is member of this group). Because viruses must use the same genetic code as their hosts, modifications to the standard genetic code could interfere with the synthesis or functioning of viral proteins. However, some viruses (such as totiviruses) have adapted to the genetic code modification of the host. In bacteria and archaea, GUG and UUG are common start codons, but in rare cases, certain proteins may use alternative start codons not normally used by that species.\n\nIn certain proteins, non-standard amino acids are substituted for standard stop codons, depending on associated signal sequences in the messenger RNA. For example, UGA can code for selenocysteine and UAG can code for pyrrolysine. Selenocysteine is now viewed as the 21st amino acid, and pyrrolysine is viewed as the 22nd. Unlike selenocysteine, pyrrolysine encoded UAG is translated with the participation of a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Both selenocysteine and pyrrolysine may be present in the same organism. Although the genetic code is normally fixed in an organism, the achaeal prokaryote \"Acetohalobium arabaticum\" can expand its genetic code from 20 to 21 amino acids (by including pyrrolysine) under different conditions of growth.\n\nDespite these differences, all known naturally occurring codes are very similar to each other, and the coding mechanism is the same for all organisms: three-base codons, tRNA, ribosomes, reading the code in the same direction and translating the code three letters at a time into sequences of amino acids.\n\nVariant genetic codes used by an organism can be inferred by identifying highly conserved genes encoded in that genome, and comparing its codon usage to the amino acids in homologous proteins of other organisms. For example, the program FACIL infers a genetic code by searching which amino acids in homologous protein domains are most often aligned to every codon. The resulting amino acid probabilities for each codon are displayed in a genetic code logo, that also shows the support for a stop codon.\n\nThe DNA codon table is essentially identical to that for RNA, but with U replaced by T.\n\nThe origin of the genetic code is a part of the question of the origin of life. Under the main hypothesis for the origin of life, the RNA world hypothesis, any model for the emergence of genetic code is intimately related to a model of the transfer from ribozymes (RNA enzymes) to proteins as the principal enzymes in cells. In line with the RNA world hypothesis, transfer RNA molecules appear to have evolved before modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, so the latter cannot be part of the explanation of its patterns.\n\nA consideration of a hypothetical random genetic code further motivates a biochemical or evolutionary model for the origin of the genetic code. If amino acids were randomly assigned to triplet codons, there would be 1.5Â ÃÂ 10 possible genetic codes to choose from. This number is found by calculating how many ways there are to place 21 items (20 amino acids plus one stop) in 64 bins, wherein each item is used at least once. In fact, the distribution of codon assignments in the genetic code is nonrandom. In particular, the genetic code clusters certain amino acid assignments. For example, amino acids that share the same biosynthetic pathway tend to have the same first base in their codons. This could be an evolutionary relic of early simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids, that later diverged to code for a larger set of amino acids. It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.\n\nGiven the non-random genetic triplet coding scheme, it has been suggested that a tenable hypothesis for the origin of genetic code should address multiple aspects of the codon table such as absence of codons for D-amino acids, secondary codon patterns for some amino acids, confinement of synonymous positions to third position, a limited set of only 20 amino acids instead of a number closer to 64, and the relation of stop codon patterns to amino acid coding patterns.\n\nThere are three main ideas for the origin of the genetic code, and many models belong to either one of them or to a combination thereof:\n\n\nHypotheses for the origin of the genetic code have addressed a variety of scenarios:\n\nSince 2001, 40 non-natural amino acids have been added into protein by creating a unique codon (recoding) and a corresponding transfer-RNA:aminoacylÂ â tRNA-synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins.\nH. Murakami and M. Sisido have extended some codons to have four and five bases. Steven A. Benner constructed a functional 65th (\"in vivo\") codon.\n\n", "id": "12385", "title": "Genetic code"}

The figure on the right illustrates the geometric relationship. Expressed algebraically, for quantities \"a\" and \"b\" with \"a\"Â >Â \"b\"Â >Â 0,\n\nwhere the Greek letter phi (formula_2 or formula_3) represents the golden ratio. Its value is:\n\nThe golden ratio is also called the golden mean or golden section (Latin: \"sectio aurea\"). Other names include extreme and mean ratio, medial section, divine proportion, divine section (Latin: \"sectio divina\"), golden proportion, golden cut, and golden number.\n\nSome twentieth-century artists and architects, including Le Corbusier and DalÃ­, have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratioâespecially in the form of the golden rectangle, in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratioâbelieving this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing. The golden ratio appears in some patterns in nature, including the spiral arrangement of leaves and other plant parts.\n\nMathematicians since Euclid have studied the properties of the golden ratio, including its appearance in the dimensions of a regular pentagon and in a golden rectangle, which may be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same aspect ratio. The golden ratio has also been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects as well as man-made systems such as financial markets, in some cases based on dubious fits to data.\n\nTwo quantities \"a\" and \"b\" are said to be in the \"golden ratio\" if\n\nOne method for finding the value of is to start with the left fraction. Through simplifying the fraction and substituting in b/a = 1/,\n\nTherefore,\n\nMultiplying by gives\n\nwhich can be rearranged to\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, two solutions are obtained:\n\nand\n\nBecause is the ratio between positive quantities is necessarily positive:\n\nThis derivation can also be found with a compass-and-straightedge construction:\n\nThe golden ratio has been claimed to have held a special fascination for at least 2,400 years, although without reliable evidence. According to Mario Livio:\n\nAncient Greek mathematicians first studied what we now call the golden ratio because of its frequent appearance in geometry. The division of a line into \"extreme and mean ratio\" (the golden section) is important in the geometry of regular pentagrams and pentagons. Euclid's \"Elements\" (Greek: ) provides the first known written definition of what is now called the golden ratio:\n\nEuclid explains a construction for cutting (sectioning) a line \"in extreme and mean ratio\" (i.e., the golden ratio). Throughout the \"Elements\", several propositions (theorems in modern terminology) and their proofs employ the golden ratio.\n\nThe golden ratio is explored in Luca Pacioli's book \"De divina proportione\" (1509).\n\nThe first known approximation of the (inverse) golden ratio by a decimal fraction, stated as \"about 0.6180340\", was written in 1597 by Michael Maestlin of the University of TÃ¼bingen in a letter to his former student Johannes Kepler.\n\nSince the 20th century, the golden ratio has been represented by the Greek letter Ï (phi, after Phidias, a sculptor who is said to have employed it) or less commonly by Ï (tau, the first letter of the ancient Greek root ÏÎ¿Î¼Î®âmeaning \"cut\").\n\nTimeline according to Priya Hemenway:\n\n\"De Divina Proportione\", a three-volume work by Luca Pacioli, was published in 1509. Pacioli, a Franciscan friar, was known mostly as a mathematician, but he was also trained and keenly interested in art. \"De Divina Proportione\" explored the mathematics of the golden ratio. Though it is often said that Pacioli advocated the golden ratio's application to yield pleasing, harmonious proportions, Livio points out that the interpretation has been traced to an error in 1799, and that Pacioli actually advocated the Vitruvian system of rational proportions. Pacioli also saw Catholic religious significance in the ratio, which led to his work's title. \"De Divina Proportione\" contains illustrations of regular solids by Leonardo da Vinci, Pacioli's longtime friend and collaborator; these are not directly linked to the golden ratio.\n\nThe Parthenon's faÃ§ade as well as elements of its faÃ§ade and elsewhere are said by some to be circumscribed by golden rectangles. Other scholars deny that the Greeks had any aesthetic association with golden ratio. For example, Midhat J. GazalÃ© says, \"It was not until Euclid, however, that the golden ratio's mathematical properties were studied. In the \"Elements\" (308 BC) the Greek mathematician merely regarded that number as an interesting irrational number, in connection with the middle and extreme ratios. Its occurrence in regular pentagons and decagons was duly observed, as well as in the dodecahedron (a regular polyhedron whose twelve faces are regular pentagons). It is indeed exemplary that the great Euclid, contrary to generations of mystics who followed, would soberly treat that number for what it is, without attaching to it other than its factual properties.\" And Keith Devlin says, \"Certainly, the oft repeated assertion that the Parthenon in Athens is based on the golden ratio is not supported by actual measurements. In fact, the entire story about the Greeks and golden ratio seems to be without foundation. The one thing we know for sure is that Euclid, in his famous textbook \"Elements\", written around 300 BC, showed how to calculate its value.\" Later sources like Vitruvius exclusively discuss proportions that can be expressed in whole numbers, i.e. commensurate as opposed to irrational proportions.\n\nA 2004 geometrical analysis of earlier research into the Great Mosque of Kairouan reveals a consistent application of the golden ratio throughout the design, according to Boussora and Mazouz. They found ratios close to the golden ratio in the overall proportion of the plan and in the dimensioning of the prayer space, the court, and the minaret. The authors note, however, that the areas where ratios close to the golden ratio were found are not part of the original construction, and theorize that these elements were added in a reconstruction.\n\nThe Swiss architect Le Corbusier, famous for his contributions to the modern international style, centered his design philosophy on systems of harmony and proportion. Le Corbusier's faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden ratio and the Fibonacci series, which he described as \"rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages and the learned.\"\n\nLe Corbusier explicitly used the golden ratio in his Modulor system for the scale of architectural proportion. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of Vitruvius, Leonardo da Vinci's \"Vitruvian Man\", the work of Leon Battista Alberti, and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of architecture. In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on human measurements, Fibonacci numbers, and the double unit. He took suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the Modulor system. Le Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in Garches exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.\n\nAnother Swiss architect, Mario Botta, bases many of his designs on geometric figures. Several private houses he designed in Switzerland are composed of squares and circles, cubes and cylinders. In a house he designed in Origlio, the golden ratio is the proportion between the central section and the side sections of the house.\n\nIn a recent book, author Jason Elliot speculated that the golden ratio was used by the designers of the Naqsh-e Jahan Square and the adjacent Lotfollah mosque.\n\nFrom measurements of 15 temples, 18 monumental tombs, 8 sarcophagi, and 58 grave stelae from the fifth century BC to the second century AD, one researcher has concluded that the golden ratio was totally absent from Greek architecture of the classical fifth century BC, and almost absent during the following six centuries.\n\nThe 16th-century philosopher Heinrich Agrippa drew a man over a pentagram inside a circle, implying a relationship to the golden ratio.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci's illustrations of polyhedra in \"De divina proportione\" (\"On the Divine Proportion\") and his views that some bodily proportions exhibit the golden ratio have led some scholars to speculate that he incorporated the golden ratio in his paintings. But the suggestion that his \"Mona Lisa\", for example, employs golden ratio proportions, is not supported by anything in Leonardo's own writings. Similarly, although the \"Vitruvian Man\" is often shown in connection with the golden ratio, the proportions of the figure do not actually match it, and the text only mentions whole number ratios.\n\nSalvador DalÃ­, influenced by the works of Matila Ghyka, explicitly used the golden ratio in his masterpiece, \"The Sacrament of the Last Supper\". The dimensions of the canvas are a golden rectangle. A huge dodecahedron, in perspective so that edges appear in golden ratio to one another, is suspended above and behind Jesus and dominates the composition.\n\nMondrian has been said to have used the golden section extensively in his geometrical paintings, though other experts (including critic Yve-Alain Bois) have disputed this claim.\n\nA statistical study on 565 works of art of different great painters, performed in 1999, found that these artists had not used the golden ratio in the size of their canvases. The study concluded that the average ratio of the two sides of the paintings studied is 1.34, with averages for individual artists ranging from 1.04 (Goya) to 1.46 (Bellini). On the other hand, Pablo Tosto listed over 350 works by well-known artists, including more than 100 which have canvasses with golden rectangle and root-5 proportions, and others with proportions like root-2, 3, 4, and 6.\n\nAccording to Jan Tschichold,\n\nThere was a time when deviations from the truly beautiful page proportions 2:3, 1:â3, and the Golden Section were rare. Many books produced between 1550 and 1770 show these proportions exactly, to within half a millimeter.\n\nSome sources claim that the golden ratio is commonly used in everyday design, for example in the shapes of postcards, playing cards, posters, wide-screen televisions, photographs, light switch plates and cars.\n\nErnÅ Lendvai analyzes BÃ©la BartÃ³k's works as being based on two opposing systems, that of the golden ratio and the acoustic scale, though other music scholars reject that analysis. French composer Erik Satie used the golden ratio in several of his pieces, including \"Sonneries de la Rose+Croix\". The golden ratio is also apparent in the organization of the sections in the music of Debussy's \"Reflets dans l'eau (Reflections in Water)\", from \"Images\" (1st series, 1905), in which \"the sequence of keys is marked out by the intervals 34, 21, 13 and 8, and the main climax sits at the phi position.\"\n\nThe musicologist Roy Howat has observed that the formal boundaries of \"La Mer\" correspond exactly to the golden section. Trezise finds the intrinsic evidence \"remarkable,\" but cautions that no written or reported evidence suggests that Debussy consciously sought such proportions.\n\nPearl Drums positions the air vents on its Masters Premium models based on the golden ratio. The company claims that this arrangement improves bass response and has applied for a patent on this innovation.\n\nThough Heinz Bohlen proposed the non-octave-repeating 833 cents scale based on combination tones, the tuning features relations based on the golden ratio. As a musical interval the ratio 1.618... is 833.090... cents ().\n\nAdolf Zeising, whose main interests were mathematics and philosophy, found the golden ratio expressed in the arrangement of parts such as leaves and branches along the stems of plants and of veins in leaves. He extended his research to the skeletons of animals and the branchings of their veins and nerves, to the proportions of chemical compounds and the geometry of crystals, even to the use of proportion in artistic endeavors. In these patterns in nature he saw the golden ratio operating as a universal law. In connection with his scheme for golden-ratio-based human body proportions, Zeising wrote in 1854 of a universal law \"in which is contained the ground-principle of all formative striving for beauty and completeness in the realms of both nature and art, and which permeates, as a paramount spiritual ideal, all structures, forms and proportions, whether cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, acoustic or optical; which finds its fullest realization, however, in the human form.\"\n\nIn 2010, the journal \"Science\" reported that the golden ratio is present at the atomic scale in the magnetic resonance of spins in cobalt niobate crystals.\n\nSince 1991, several researchers have proposed connections between the golden ratio and human genome DNA.\n\nHowever, some have argued that many apparent manifestations of the golden ratio in nature, especially in regard to animal dimensions, are fictitious.\n\nThe golden ratio is key to the golden section search.\n\nStudies by psychologists, starting with Fechner, have been devised to test the idea that the golden ratio plays a role in human perception of beauty. While Fechner found a preference for rectangle ratios centered on the golden ratio, later attempts to carefully test such a hypothesis have been, at best, inconclusive.\n\nThe golden ratio is an irrational number. Below are two short proofs of irrationality:\n\nRecall that:\n\nIf we call the whole \"n\" and the longer part \"m\", then the second statement above becomes\n\nor, algebraically\n\nTo say that is rational means that is a fraction \"n\"/\"m\" where \"n\" and \"m\" are integers. We may take \"n\"/\"m\" to be in lowest terms and \"n\" and \"m\" to be positive. But if \"n\"/\"m\" is in lowest terms, then the identity labeled (*) above says \"m\"/(\"n\"Â âÂ \"m\") is in still lower terms. That is a contradiction that follows from the assumption that is rational.\n\nAnother short proofâperhaps more commonly knownâof the irrationality of the golden ratio makes use of the closure of rational numbers under addition and multiplication. If formula_41 is rational, then formula_42 is also rational, which is a contradiction if it is already known that the square root of a non-square natural number is irrational.\n\nThe golden ratio is also an algebraic number and even an algebraic integer. It has minimal polynomial\n\nHaving degree 2, this polynomial actually has two roots, the other being the golden ratio conjugate.\n\nThe conjugate root to the minimal polynomial x - x - 1 is\n\nThe absolute value of this quantity (â 0.618) corresponds to the length ratio taken in reverse order (shorter segment length over longer segment length, \"b/a\"), and is sometimes referred to as the \"golden ratio conjugate\". It is denoted here by the capital Phi (formula_45):\n\nAlternatively, formula_45 can be expressed as\n\nThis illustrates the unique property of the golden ratio among positive numbers, that\n\nor its inverse:\n\nThis means 0.61803...:1 = 1:1.61803...\n\nThe formula = 1 + 1/ can be expanded recursively to obtain a continued fraction for the golden ratio:\n\nand its reciprocal:\n\nThe convergents of these continued fractions (1/1, 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5, 13/8, ..., or 1/1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/5, 5/8, 8/13, ...) are ratios of successive Fibonacci numbers.\n\nThe equation = 1 + likewise produces the continued square root, or infinite surd, form:\n\nAn infinite series can be derived to express phi:\n\nAlso:\n\nThese correspond to the fact that the length of the diagonal of a regular pentagon is times the length of its side, and similar relations in a pentagram.\n\nThe number turns up frequently in geometry, particularly in figures with pentagonal symmetry.\nThe length of a regular pentagon's diagonal is times its side.\nThe vertices of a regular icosahedron are those of three mutually orthogonal golden rectangles.\n\nThere is no known general algorithm to arrange a given number of nodes evenly on a sphere, for any of several definitions of even distribution (see, for example, \"Thomson problem\"). However, a useful approximation results from dividing the sphere into parallel bands of equal surface area and placing one node in each band at longitudes spaced by a golden section of the circle, i.e. 360Â°/ â 222.5Â°. This method was used to arrange the 1500 mirrors of the student-participatory satellite Starshine-3.\n\nApplication examples you can see in the articles Pentagon with a given side length, Decagon with given circumcircle and Decagon with a given side length.\n\nThe both above displayed different algorithms produce geometric constructions that divides a line segment into two line segments where the ratio of the longer to the shorter line segment is the golden ratio.\nThe golden triangle can be characterized as an isosceles triangle ABC with the property that bisecting the angle C produces a new triangle CXB which is a similar triangle to the original.\n\nIf angle BCX = Î±, then XCA = Î± because of the bisection, and CAB = Î± because of the similar triangles; ABC = 2Î± from the original isosceles symmetry, and BXC = 2Î± by similarity. The angles in a triangle add up to 180Â°, so 5Î± = 180, giving Î± = 36Â°. So the angles of the golden triangle are thus 36Â°-72Â°-72Â°. The angles of the remaining obtuse isosceles triangle AXC (sometimes called the golden gnomon) are 36Â°-36Â°-108Â°.\n\nSuppose XB has length 1, and we call BC length . Because of the isosceles triangles XC=XA and BC=XC, so these are also lengthÂ Ï. Length ACÂ =Â AB, therefore equals Â +Â 1. But triangle ABC is similar to triangle CXB, so AC/BCÂ =Â BC/BX, AC/Â =Â Ï/1, and so AC also equals . Thus =Â ÏÂ +Â 1, confirming that is indeed the golden ratio.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio of the area of the larger triangle AXC to the smaller CXB is equal to , while the inverse ratio isÂ ÏÂ âÂ 1.\n\nIn a regular pentagon the ratio between a side and a diagonal is formula_45 (i.e. 1/), while intersecting diagonals section each other in the golden ratio.\n\nGeorge Odom has given a remarkably simple construction for involving an equilateral triangle: if an equilateral triangle is inscribed in a circle and the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides is produced to intersect the circle in either of two points, then these three points are in golden proportion. This result is a straightforward consequence of the intersecting chords theorem and can be used to construct a regular pentagon, a construction that attracted the attention of the noted Canadian geometer H. S. M. Coxeter who published it in Odom's name as a diagram in the \"American Mathematical Monthly\" accompanied by the single word \"Behold!\" \n\nThe golden ratio plays an important role in the geometry of pentagrams. Each intersection of edges sections other edges in the golden ratio. Also, the ratio of the length of the shorter segment to the segment bounded by the two intersecting edges (a side of the pentagon in the pentagram's center) is , as the four-color illustration shows.\n\nThe pentagram includes ten isosceles triangles: five acute and five obtuse isosceles triangles. In all of them, the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side is . The acute triangles are golden triangles. The obtuse isosceles triangles are golden gnomons.\n\nThe golden ratio properties of a regular pentagon can be confirmed by applying Ptolemy's theorem to the quadrilateral formed by removing one of its vertices. If the quadrilateral's long edge and diagonals are \"b\", and short edges are \"a\", then Ptolemy's theorem gives \"b\"Â =Â \"a\"Â +Â \"ab\" which yields\n\nConsider a triangle with sides of lengths \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" in decreasing order. Define the \"scalenity\" of the triangle to be the smaller of the two ratios \"a\"/\"b\" and \"b\"/\"c\". The scalenity is always less than and can be made as close as desired to .\n\nIf the side lengths of a triangle form a geometric progression and are in the ratio 1 : \"r\" : \"r\", where \"r\" is the common ratio, then \"r\" must lie in the range â1 < \"r\" < , which is a consequence of the triangle inequality (the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be strictly bigger than the length of the third side). If \"r\" = then the shorter two sides are 1 and but their sum is , thus \"r\" < . A similar calculation shows that \"r\" > â1. A triangle whose sides are in the ratio 1 : â : is a right triangle (because 1 + = ) known as a Kepler triangle.\n\nA golden rhombus is a rhombus whose diagonals are in the golden ratio. The rhombic triacontahedron is a convex polytope that has a very special property: all of its faces are golden rhombi. In the rhombic triacontahedron the dihedral angle between any two adjacent rhombi is 144Â°, which is twice the isosceles angle of a golden triangle and four times its most acute angle.\n\nThe mathematics of the golden ratio and of the Fibonacci sequence are intimately interconnected. The Fibonacci sequence is:\n\nThe closed-form expression for the Fibonacci sequence involves the golden ratio:\n\nThe golden ratio is the limit of the ratios of successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence (or any Fibonacci-like sequence), as originally shown by Kepler:\n\nTherefore, if a Fibonacci number is divided by its immediate predecessor in the sequence, the quotient approximates ; e.g., 987/610Â Â 1.6180327868852. These approximations are alternately lower and higher than , and converge on as the Fibonacci numbers increase, and:\n\nMore generally:\n\nwhere above, the ratios of consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence, is a case when formula_13.\n\nFurthermore, the successive powers of obey the Fibonacci recurrence:\n\nThis identity allows any polynomial in to be reduced to a linear expression. For example:\n\nThe reduction to a linear expression can be accomplished in one step by using the relationship\nwhere formula_69 is the \"k\" Fibonacci number.\n\nHowever, this is no special property of , because polynomials in any solution \"x\" to a quadratic equation can be reduced in an analogous manner, by applying:\nfor given coefficients \"a\", \"b\" such that \"x\" satisfies the equation. Even more generally, any rational function (with rational coefficients) of the root of an irreducible \"n\"th-degree polynomial over the rationals can be reduced to a polynomial of degree \"n\" â 1. Phrased in terms of field theory, if Î± is a root of an irreducible \"n\"th-degree polynomial, then formula_71 has degree \"n\" over formula_72, with basis formula_73.\n\nThe golden ratio and inverse golden ratio formula_74 have a set of symmetries that preserve and interrelate them. They are both preserved by the fractional linear transformations formula_75 â this fact corresponds to the identity and the definition quadratic equation.\nFurther, they are interchanged by the three maps formula_76 â they are reciprocals, symmetric about formula_77, and (projectively) symmetric about 2.\n\nMore deeply, these maps form a subgroup of the modular group formula_78 isomorphic to the symmetric group on 3 letters, formula_79 corresponding to the stabilizer of the set formula_80 of 3 standard points on the projective line, and the symmetries correspond to the quotient map formula_81 â the subgroup formula_82 consisting of the 3-cycles and the identity formula_83 fixes the two numbers, while the 2-cycles interchange these, thus realizing the map.\n\nThe golden ratio has the simplest expression (and slowest convergence) as a continued fraction expansion of any irrational number (see \"Alternate forms\" above). It is, for that reason, one of the worst cases of Lagrange's approximation theorem and it is an extremal case of the Hurwitz inequality for Diophantine approximations. This may be why angles close to the golden ratio often show up in phyllotaxis (the growth of plants).\n\nThe defining quadratic polynomial and the conjugate relationship lead to decimal values that have their fractional part in common with :\n\nThe sequence of powers of contains these values 0.618..., 1.0, 1.618..., 2.618...; more generally,\nany power of is equal to the sum of the two immediately preceding powers:\n\nAs a result, one can easily decompose any power of into a multiple of and a constant. The multiple and the constant are always adjacent Fibonacci numbers. This leads to another property of the positive powers of :\n\nIf formula_87, then:\n\nWhen the golden ratio is used as the base of a numeral system (see Golden ratio base, sometimes dubbed \"phinary\" or \"-nary\"), every integer has a terminating representation, despite being irrational, but every fraction has a non-terminating representation.\n\nThe golden ratio is a fundamental unit of the algebraic number field formula_90 and is a PisotâVijayaraghavan number. In the field formula_90 we have formula_92, where formula_93 is the formula_94-th Lucas number.\n\nThe golden ratio also appears in hyperbolic geometry, as the maximum distance from a point on one side of an ideal triangle to the closer of the other two sides: this distance, the side length of the equilateral triangle formed by the points of tangency of a circle inscribed within the ideal triangle, is formula_95.\n\nThe golden ratio's decimal expansion can be calculated directly from the expression\n\nwith â5 â 2.2360679774997896964 . The square root of 5 can be calculated with the Babylonian method, starting with an initial estimate such as \"x\" = 2 and iterating\n\nfor \"n\" = 1, 2, 3, ..., until the difference between \"x\" and \"x\" becomes zero, to the desired number of digits.\n\nThe Babylonian algorithm for â5 is equivalent to Newton's method for solving the equation \"x\"Â âÂ 5 = 0. In its more general form, Newton's method can be applied directly to any algebraic equation, including the equation \"x\"Â âÂ xÂ âÂ 1 = 0 that defines the golden ratio. This gives an iteration that converges to the golden ratio itself,\n\nfor an appropriate initial estimate \"x\" such as \"x\" = 1. A slightly faster method is to rewrite the equation as \"x\"Â âÂ 1Â âÂ 1/\"x\" = 0, in which case the Newton iteration becomes\n\nThese iterations all converge quadratically; that is, each step roughly doubles the number of correct digits. The golden ratio is therefore relatively easy to compute with arbitrary precision. The time needed to compute \"n\" digits of the golden ratio is proportional to the time needed to divide two \"n\"-digit numbers. This is considerably faster than known algorithms for the transcendental numbers and .\n\nAn easily programmed alternative using only integer arithmetic is to calculate two large consecutive Fibonacci numbers and divide them. The ratio of Fibonacci numbers \"F\" and \"F\" , each over 5000 digits, yields over 10,000 significant digits of the golden ratio.\n\nThe decimal expansion of the golden ratio () has been calculated to an accuracy of two trillion ( = 2,000,000,000,000) digits.\n\nBoth Egyptian pyramids and the regular square pyramids that resemble them can be analyzed with respect to the golden ratio and other ratios.\n\nA pyramid in which the apothem (slant height along the bisector of a face) is equal to times the semi-base (half the base width) is sometimes called a \"golden pyramid\". The isosceles triangle that is the face of such a pyramid can be constructed from the two halves of a diagonally split golden rectangle (of size semi-base by apothem), joining the medium-length edges to make the apothem. The height of this pyramid is formula_100 times the semi-base (that is, the slope of the face is formula_100); the square of the height is equal to the area of a face, times the square of the semi-base.\n\nThe medial right triangle of this \"golden\" pyramid (see diagram), with sides formula_102 is interesting in its own right, demonstrating via the Pythagorean theorem the relationship formula_103 or formula_104. This Kepler triangle\nis the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in geometric progression, just as the 3â4â5 triangle is the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in arithmetic progression. The angle with tangent formula_100 corresponds to the angle that the side of the pyramid makes with respect to the ground, 51.827... degrees (51Â° 49' 38\").\n\nA nearly similar pyramid shape, but with rational proportions, is described in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (the source of a large part of modern knowledge of ancient Egyptian mathematics), based on the 3:4:5 triangle; the face slope corresponding to the angle with tangent 4/3 is 53.13 degrees (53 degrees and 8 minutes). The slant height or apothem is 5/3 or 1.666... times the semi-base. The Rhind papyrus has another pyramid problem as well, again with rational slope (expressed as run over rise). Egyptian mathematics did not include the notion of irrational numbers, and the rational inverse slope (run/rise, multiplied by a factor of 7 to convert to their conventional units of palms per cubit) was used in the building of pyramids.\n\nAnother mathematical pyramid with proportions almost identical to the \"golden\" one is the one with perimeter equal to 2 times the height, or h:b = 4:. This triangle has a face angle of 51.854Â° (51Â°51'), very close to the 51.827Â° of the Kepler triangle. This pyramid relationship corresponds to the coincidental relationship formula_106.\n\nEgyptian pyramids very close in proportion to these mathematical pyramids are known.\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, RÃ¶ber studied various Egyptian pyramids including Khafre, Menkaure and some of the Giza, Sakkara, and Abusir groups, and was interpreted as saying that half the base of the side of the pyramid is the middle mean of the side, forming what other authors identified as the Kepler triangle; many other mathematical theories of the shape of the pyramids have also been explored.\n\nOne Egyptian pyramid is remarkably close to a \"golden pyramid\"âthe Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu). Its slope of 51Â° 52' is extremely close to the \"golden\" pyramid inclination of 51Â° 50' and the -based pyramid inclination of 51Â° 51'; other pyramids at Giza (Chephren, 52Â° 20', and Mycerinus, 50Â° 47') are also quite close. Whether the relationship to the golden ratio in these pyramids is by design or by accident remains open to speculation. Several other Egyptian pyramids are very close to the rational 3:4:5 shape.\n\nAdding fuel to controversy over the architectural authorship of the Great Pyramid, Eric Temple Bell, mathematician and historian, claimed in 1950 that Egyptian mathematics would not have supported the ability to calculate the slant height of the pyramids, or the ratio to the height, except in the case of the 3:4:5 pyramid, since the 3:4:5 triangle was the only right triangle known to the Egyptians and they did not know the Pythagorean theorem, nor any way to reason about irrationals such as or .\n\nMichael Rice asserts that principal authorities on the history of Egyptian architecture have argued that the Egyptians were well acquainted with the golden ratio and that it is part of mathematics of the Pyramids, citing Giedon (1957). Historians of science have always debated whether the Egyptians had any such knowledge or not, contending rather that its appearance in an Egyptian building is the result of chance.\n\nIn 1859, the pyramidologist John Taylor claimed that, in the Great Pyramid of Giza, the golden ratio is represented by the ratio of the length of the face (the slope height), inclined at an angle Î¸ to the ground, to half the length of the side of the square base, equivalent to the secant of the angle Î¸. The above two lengths were about 186.4 and 115.2 meters respectively. The ratio of these lengths is the golden ratio, accurate to more digits than either of the original measurements. Similarly, Howard Vyse, according to Matila Ghyka, reported the great pyramid height 148.2 m, and half-base 116.4 m, yielding 1.6189 for the ratio of slant height to half-base, again more accurate than the data variability.\n\nExamples of disputed observations of the golden ratio include the following:\n\n\n", "id": "12386", "title": "Golden ratio"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12388", "text": "Genome\n\nIn modern molecular biology and genetics, a genome is the genetic material of an organism. It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes, (the coding regions), the noncoding DNA and the genomes of the mitochondria and chloroplasts.\n\nThe term \"genome\" was created in 1920 by Hans Winkler, professor of botany at the University of Hamburg, Germany. The Oxford Dictionary suggests the name is a blend of the words \"gene\" and \"chromosome\". However, see omics for a more thorough discussion. A few related \"-ome\" words already existedâsuch as \"biome\", \"rhizome\", forming a vocabulary into which \"genome\" fits systematically.\n\nSome organisms have multiple copies of chromosomes: diploid, triploid, tetraploid and so on. In classical genetics, in a sexually reproducing organism (typically eukarya) the gamete has half the number of chromosomes of the somatic cell and the genome is a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell. The halving of the genetic material in gametes is accomplished by the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. In haploid organisms, including cells of bacteria, archaea, and in organelles including mitochondria and chloroplasts, or viruses, that similarly contain genes, the single or set of circular or linear chains of DNA (or RNA for some viruses), likewise constitute the genome. The term \"genome\" can be applied specifically to mean what is stored on a complete set of nuclearÂ DNA (i.e.,Â the \"nuclear genome\") but can also be applied to what is stored within organelles that contain their own DNA, as with the \"mitochondrial genome\" or the \"chloroplast genome\". Additionally, the genome can comprise non-chromosomal genetic elements such as viruses, plasmids, and transposable elements.\n\nTypically, when it is said that the genome of a sexually reproducing species has been \"sequenced\", it refers to a determination of the sequences of one set of autosomes and one of each type of sex chromosome, which together represent both of the possible sexes. Even in species that exist in only one sex, what is described as a \"genome sequence\" may be a composite read from the chromosomes of various individuals. Colloquially, the phrase \"genetic makeup\" is sometimes used to signify the genome of a particular individual or organism. The study of the global properties of genomes of related organisms is usually referred to as genomics, which distinguishes it from genetics which generally studies the properties of single genes or groups of genes.\n\nBoth the number of base pairs and the number of genes vary widely from one species to another, and there is only a rough correlation between the two (an observation is known as the C-value paradox). At present, the highest known number of genes is around 60,000, for the protozoan causing trichomoniasis (see List of sequenced eukaryotic genomes), almost three times as many as in the human genome.\n\nAn analogy to the human genome stored on DNA is that of instructions stored in a book:\n\nIn 1976, Walter Fiers at the University of Ghent (Belgium) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a viral RNA-genome (Bacteriophage MS2). The next year Fred Sanger completed the first DNA-genome sequence: Phage Î¦-X174, of 5386 base pairs. The first complete genome sequences among all three domains of life were released within a short period during the mid-1990s: The first bacterial genome to be sequenced was that of Haemophilus influenzae, completed by a team at The Institute for Genomic Research in 1995. A few months later, the first eukaryotic genome was completed, with sequences of the 16 chromosomes of budding yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" published as the result of a European-led effort begun in the mid-1980s. The first genome sequence for an archaeon, \"Methanococcus jannaschii\", was completed in 1996, again by The Institute for Genomic Research.\n\nThe development of new technologies has made it dramatically easier and cheaper to do sequencing, and the number of complete genome sequences is growing rapidly. The US National Institutes of Health maintains one of several comprehensive databases of genomic information. Among the thousands of completed genome sequencing projects include those for rice, a mouse, the plant \"Arabidopsis thaliana\", the puffer fish, and the bacteria E. coli. In December 2013, scientists first sequenced the entire \"genome\" of a Neanderthal, an extinct species of humans. The genome was extracted from the toe bone of a 130,000-year-old Neanderthal found in a Siberian cave.\n\nNew sequencing technologies, such as massive parallel sequencing have also opened up the prospect of personal genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool, as pioneered by Manteia Predictive Medicine. A major step toward that goal was the completion in 2007 of the full genome of James D. Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA.\n\nWhereas a genome sequence lists the order of every DNA base in a genome, a genome map identifies the landmarks. A genome map is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in navigating around the genome. The Human Genome Project was organized to map and to sequence the human genome. A fundamental step in the project was the release of a detailed genomic map by Jean Weissenbach and his team at the Genoscope in Paris.\n\nReference genome sequences and maps continue to be updated, removing errors and clarifying regions of high allelic complexity. The decreasing cost of genomic mapping has permitted genealogical sites to offer it as a service, to the extent that one may submit one's genome to crowd sourced scientific endeavours such as DNA.land at the New York Genome Center, an example both of the economies of scale and of citizen science.\n\nGenome composition is used to describe the make up of contents of a haploid genome, which should include genome size, proportions of non-repetitive DNA and repetitive DNA in details. By comparing the genome compositions between genomes, scientists can better understand the evolutionary history of a given genome.\n\nWhen talking about genome composition, one should distinguish between prokaryotes and eukaryotes as there are significant differences with contents structure. In prokaryotes, most of the genome (85â90%) is non-repetitive DNA, which means coding DNA mainly forms it, while non-coding regions only take a small part. On the contrary, eukaryotes have the feature of exon-intron organization of protein coding genes; the variation of repetitive DNA content in eukaryotes is also extremely high. In mammals and plants, the major part of the genome is composed of repetitive DNA.\n\nMost biological entities that are more complex than a virus sometimes or always carry additional genetic material besides that which resides in their chromosomes. In some contexts, such as sequencing the genome of a pathogenic microbe, \"genome\" is meant to include information stored on this auxiliary material, which is carried in plasmids. In such circumstances then, \"genome\" describes all of the genes and information on non-coding DNA that have the potential to be present.\n\nIn eukaryotes such as plants, protozoa and animals, however, \"genome\" carries the typical connotation of only information on chromosomal DNA. So although these organisms contain chloroplasts or mitochondria that have their own DNA, the genetic information contained in DNA within these organelles is not considered part of the genome. In fact, mitochondria are sometimes said to have their own genome often referred to as the \"mitochondrial genome\". The DNA found within the chloroplast may be referred to as the \"plastome\".\n\nGenome size is the total number of DNA base pairs in one copy of a haploid genome. In humans, the nuclear genome comprises approximately 3.2 billion nucleotides of DNA, divided into 24 linear molecules, the shortest 50 000 000 nucleotides in length and the longest 260 000 000 nucleotides, each contained in a different chromosome. The genome size is positively correlated with the morphological complexity among prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes; however, after mollusks and all the other higher eukaryotes above, this correlation is no longer effective. This phenomenon also indicates the mighty influence coming from repetitive DNA act on the genomes.\n\nSince genomes are very complex, one research strategy is to reduce the number of genes in a genome to the bare minimum and still have the organism in question survive. There is experimental work being done on minimal genomes for single cell organisms as well as minimal genomes for multi-cellular organisms (see Developmental biology). The work is both \"in vivo\" and \"in silico\".\n\nHere is a table of some significant or representative genomes. See #See also for lists of sequenced genomes.\n\nThe proportion of non-repetitive DNA is calculated by using the length of non-repetitive DNA divided by genome size. Protein-coding genes and RNA-coding genes are generally non-repetitive DNA. A bigger genome does not mean more genes, and the proportion of non-repetitive DNA decreases along with increasing genome size in higher eukaryotes.\n\nIt had been found that the proportion of non-repetitive DNA can vary a lot between species. Some \"E. coli\" as prokaryotes only have non-repetitive DNA, lower eukaryotes such as \"C. elegans\" and fruit fly, still possess more non-repetitive DNA than repetitive DNA. Higher eukaryotes tend to have more repetitive DNA than non-repetitive ones. In some plants and amphibians, the proportion of non-repetitive DNA is no more than 20%, becoming a minority component.\n\nThe proportion of repetitive DNA is calculated by using length of repetitive DNA divide by genome size. There are two categories of repetitive DNA in genome: tandem repeats and interspersed repeats.\n\nTandem repeats are usually caused by slippage during replication, unequal crossing-over and gene conversion, satellite DNA and microsatellites are forms of tandem repeats in the genome. Although tandem repeats count for a significant proportion in genome, the largest proportion in mammalian is the other type, interspersed repeats.\n\nInterspersed repeats mainly come from transposable elements (TEs), but they also include some protein coding gene families and pseudogenes. Transposable elements are able to integrate into the genome at another site within the cell. It is believed that TEs are an important driving force on genome evolution of higher eukaryotes. TEs can be classified into two categories, Class 1 (retrotransposons) and Class 2 (DNA transposons).\n\nRetrotransposons can be transcribed into RNA, which are then duplicated at another site into the genome. Retrotransposons can be divided into Long terminal repeats (LTRs) and Non-Long Terminal Repeats (Non-LTR).\n\n\n\n\n\nDNA transposons generally move by \"cut and paste\" in the genome, but duplication has also been observed. Class 2 TEs do not use RNA as intermediate and are popular in bacteria, in metazoan it has also been found.\n\nGenomes are more than the sum of an organism's genes and have traits that may be measured and studied without reference to the details of any particular genes and their products. Researchers compare traits such as karyotype (chromosome number), genome size, gene order, codon usage bias, and GC-content to determine what mechanisms could have produced the great variety of genomes that exist today (for recent overviews, see Brown 2002; Saccone and Pesole 2003; Benfey and Protopapas 2004; Gibson and Muse 2004; Reese 2004; Gregory 2005).\n\nDuplications play a major role in shaping the genome. Duplication may range from extension of short tandem repeats, to duplication of a cluster of genes, and all the way to duplication of entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. Such duplications are probably fundamental to the creation of genetic novelty.\n\nHorizontal gene transfer is invoked to explain how there is often an extreme similarity between small portions of the genomes of two organisms that are otherwise very distantly related. Horizontal gene transfer seems to be common among many microbes. Also, eukaryotic cells seem to have experienced a transfer of some genetic material from their chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes to their nuclear chromosomes.\n\n\n\n", "id": "12388", "title": "Genome"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12393", "text": "Gaia philosophy\n\nGaia philosophy (named after Gaia, Greek goddess of the Earth) is a broadly inclusive term for related concepts that living organisms on a planet will affect the nature of their environment in order to make the environment more suitable for life. This set of theories holds that all organisms on a life-giving planet regulate the biosphere in such a way as to promote its habitability. Gaia concept draws a connection between the survivability of a species (hence its evolutionary course) and its usefulness to the survival of other species.\n\nWhile there were a number of precursors to Gaia theory, the first scientific form of this idea was proposed as the Gaia hypothesis by James Lovelock, a UK chemist, in 1970. The Gaia hypothesis deals with the concept of Biological homeostasis, and claims the resident life forms of a host planet coupled with their environment have acted and act like a single, self-regulating system. This system includes the near-surface rocks, the soil, and the atmosphere. Today many scientists consider such ideas to be unsupported by, or at odds with, the available evidence (see recent criticism). These theories are however significant in green politics.\n\nThere are some mystical, scientific and religious predecessors to the Gaia philosophy, which had a Gaia-like conceptual basis. Many religious mythologies had a view of Earth as being a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts (e.g. some Native American religions and various forms of shamanism).\n\nLewis Thomas believed that Earth should be viewed as a single cell; he derived this view from Johannes Kepler's view of Earth as a single round organism.\n\nIsaac Newton wrote of the earth, \"âThus this Earth resembles a great animall or rather inanimate vegetable, draws in Ã¦thereall breath for its dayly refreshment & vitall ferment & transpires again with gross exhalations, And according to the condition of all other things living ought to have its times of beginning youth old age & perishing.â\n\nPierre Teilhard de Chardin, a paleontologist and geologist, believed that evolution unfolded from cell to organism to planet to solar system and ultimately the whole universe, as we humans see it from our limited perspective. Teilhard later influenced Thomas Berry and many Catholic humanist thinkers of the 20th century.\n\nBuckminster Fuller is generally credited with making the idea respectable in Western scientific circles in the 20th century. Building to some degree on his observations and artifacts, e.g. the Dymaxion map of the Earth he created, others began to ask if there was a way to make the Gaia theory scientifically sound.\n\nOberon Zell-Ravenheart in 1970 in an article in \"Green Egg\" Magazine, independently articulated the Gaia Thesis. \n\nNone of these ideas are considered scientific hypotheses; by definition a scientific hypothesis must make testable predictions. As the above claims are not testable, they are outside the bounds of current science.\n\nThese are conjectures and perhaps can only be considered as social and maybe political philosophy; they may have implications for theology, or \"thealogy\" as Zell-Ravenheart and Isaac Bonewits put it.\n\nAccording to James Kirchner there is a spectrum of Gaia hypotheses, ranging from the undeniable to radical. At one end is the undeniable statement that the organisms on the Earth have radically altered its composition. A stronger position is that the Earth's biosphere effectively acts as if it is a self-organizing system which works in such a way as to keep its systems in some kind of equilibrium that is conducive to life. Today many scientists consider that such a view (and any stronger views) are unlikely to be correct. An even stronger claim is that all lifeforms are part of a single planetary being, called Gaia. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas, the terrestrial crust would be the result of interventions carried out by Gaia, through the coevolving diversity of living organisms.\n\nThe most extreme form of Gaia theory is that the entire Earth is a single unified organism with a highly intelligent mind that arose as an emergent property of the whole biosphere. In this view, the Earth's biosphere is \"consciously\" manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence at all to support this last point of view, and it has come about because many people do not understand the concept of homeostasis. Many non-scientists instinctively and incorrectly see homeostasis as a process that requires conscious control .\n\nThe more speculative versions of Gaia, including versions in which it is believed that the Earth is actually conscious, sentient, and highly intelligent, are usually considered outside the bounds of what is usually considered science.\n\nBuckminster Fuller has been credited as the first to incorporate scientific ideas into a Gaia theory, which he did with his Dymaxion map of the Earth.\n\nThe first scientifically rigorous theory was the Gaia hypothesis by James Lovelock, a UK chemist. This view is no longer considered plausible by many scientists .\n\nA variant of this hypothesis was developed by Lynn Margulis, a microbiologist, in 1979.\nHer version is sometimes called the \"Gaia Theory\" (note uppercase-T). Her model is more limited in scope than the one that Lovelock proposed.\n\nWhether this sort of system is present on Earth is still open to debate. Some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise, plants are able to grow better and thus remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other biological effects and feedbacks exist, but the extent to which these mechanisms have stabilized and modified the Earth's overall climate is largely not known.\n\nThe Gaia hypothesis is sometimes viewed from significantly different philosophical perspectives. Some environmentalists view it as an almost conscious process, in which the Earth's ecosystem is literally viewed as a single unified organism. Some evolutionary biologists, on the other hand, view it as an undirected emergent property of the ecosystem: as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, their combined actions tend to have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Proponents of this view sometimes point to examples of life's actions in the past that have resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a reducing environment to an oxygen-rich one.\n\nDepending on how strongly the case is stated, the hypothesis conflicts with mainstream neo-Darwinism. Most biologists would accept Daisyworld-style homeostasis as possible, but would certainly not accept the idea that this equates to the whole biosphere acting as one organism.\n\nA very small number of scientists, and a much larger number of environmental activists, claim that Earth's biosphere is \"consciously\" manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence to support this belief.\n\nA social science view of Gaia theory is the role of humans as a keystone species who may be able to accomplish global homeostasis. Whilst a few social scientists who draw inspiration from 'organic' views of society have embraced Gaia philosophy as a way to explain the human-nature interconnections, most professional social scientists are more involved in reflecting upon the way Gaia philosophy is used and engaged with within sub-sections of society. Alan Marshall, in the Department of Social Sciences at Mahidol University, for example, reflects upon the way Gaia philosophy has been used and advocated by environmentalists, spiritualists, managers, economists, and scientists and engineers (see The Unity of Nature, 2002, Imperial College Press: London and Singapore). Social Scientists themselves in the 1960s gave up on systems ideas of society since they were interpreted as supporting conservatism and traditionalism.\n\nSome radical political environmentalists who accept some form of the Gaia theory call themselves Gaians. They actively seek to restore the Earth's homeostasis â whenever they see it out of balance, e.g. to prevent manmade climate change, primate extinction, or rainforest loss. In effect, they seek to cooperate to become the \"system consciously manipulating to make conditions more conducive to life\". Such activity defines the homeostasis, but for leverage it relies on deep investigation of the homeorhetic balances, if only to find places to intervene in a system which is changing in undesirable ways.\n\nTony Bondhus brings up the point in his book, \"Society of Conceivia\", that if Gaia is alive, then societies are living things as well. This suggests that our understanding of Gaia can be used to create a better society and to design a better political system.\n\nOther intellectuals in the environmental movement, like Edward Goldsmith, have used Gaia in the completely opposite way; to stake a claim about how Gaia's focus on natural balance and resistance and resilience, should be emulated to design a conservative political system (as explored in Alan Marshall's 2002 book \"The Unity of Nature\", (Imperial College Press: London).\n\nGaians do not passively ask \"what is going on\", but rather, \"what to do next\", e.g. in terraforming or climate engineering or even on a small scale, such as gardening. Changes can be planned, agreed upon by many people, being very deliberate, as in urban ecology and especially industrial ecology. \"See arcology for more on this 'active' view.\"\n\nGaians argue that it is a human duty to act as such - committing themselves in particular to the Precautionary Principle. Such views began to influence the Green Parties, Greenpeace, and a few more radical wings of the environmental movement such as the Gaia Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front. These views dominate some such groups, e.g. the Bioneers. Some refer to this political activity as a separate and radical branch of the ecology movement, one that takes the axioms of the science of ecology in general, and Gaia theory in particular, and raises them to a kind of theory of personal conduct or moral code.\n\nThe ecologist and theologian Anne Primavesi is the author of two books dealing with the Gaia hypothesis and theology.\n\nRosemary Radford Ruether, the American feminist scholar and theologian, wrote a book called \"Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing\".\n\nA book edited by Allan Hunt Badiner called Dharma Gaia explores the ground where Buddhism and ecology meet through writings by the Dalai Lama, Gary Snyder, Thich Nhat Hanh, Allen Ginsberg, Joanna Macy, Robert Aitken, and 25 other Buddhists and ecologists.\n\nMany new age authors have written books which mix New Age teachings with Gaia philosophy. This is known as New Age Gaian. Often referred to as Gaianism, or the Gaian Religion, this spiritual aspect of the philosophy is very broad and inclusive, making it adaptable to other religions: Taoism, Neo-Paganism, Pantheism, Judeo-Christian Religions, and many others.\n\nThe question of \"what is an organism\", and at what scale is it rational to speak about organisms vs. biospheres, gives rise to a semantic debate. We are all ecologies in the sense that our (human) bodies contain gut bacteria, parasite species, etc., and to them our body is not organism but rather more of a microclimate or biome. Applying that thinking to whole planets:\n\nThe argument is that these symbiotic organisms, being unable to survive apart from each other and their climate and local conditions, form an organism in their own right, under a wider conception of the term organism than is conventionally used. It is a matter for often heated debate whether this is a valid usage of the term, but ultimately it appears to be a semantic dispute. In this sense of the word organism, it is argued under the theory that the entire biomass of the Earth is a single organism (as Johannes Kepler thought).\n\nUnfortunately, many supporters of the various Gaia theories do not state exactly where they sit on this spectrum; this makes discussion and criticism difficult.\n\nMuch effort on behalf of those analyzing the theory currently is an attempt to clarify what these different hypotheses are, and whether they are proposals to 'test' or 'manipulate' outcomes. Both Lovelock's and Margulis's understanding of Gaia are considered scientific hypotheses, and like all scientific theories are constantly put to the test.\n\nMore speculative versions of Gaia, including all versions in which it is held that the Earth is actually conscious, are currently held to be outside the bounds of science, and are not supported by either Lovelock or Margulis.\n\nOne of the most problematic issues with referring to Gaia as an organism is its apparent failure to meet the biological criterion of being able to reproduce. Richard Dawkins has asserted that the planet is not the offspring of any parents and is unable to reproduce.\n\nIsaac Asimov in his 1982 novel Foundation's Edge describes a planet known as Gaia, which is a 'superorganism'. All things on Gaia participate in a larger, group consciousness, while still retaining any individual awareness they might have, such as among the Gaian humans. Gaians were important in shaping the future course of Asimov's universe.\n\nAt least one work of fiction, the film \"\", uses Gaia philosophy as a central point to the plot, and may arguably represent a fictional parallel to Sir James Lovelock in the character of Dr. Cid, who is met with skepticism from the scientific and social community when he promotes the idea of a \"living Earth\". In the film, Dr. Cid attempts to create a \"waveform\" from the positive energy signature of the Earth's spirit, in order to combat the films antagonists, the negative energy \"Phantoms\", through use of phase inversion canceling.\n\nIn addition, Gaia philosophy is prominent in the video game \"Final Fantasy VII\", where the theme of a living planet in which all life is one is symbolized by the idea of the Lifestream. The Lifestream is not only a philosophical theme present in the game, but it actually acts as a plot device, \"erupting\" at certain points in the game. In the context of Final Fantasy VII and its various spin-offs (which include three games and a movie), the Lifestream is a collection of all the souls and energy on the earth, and is semi-sentient. In fact, in Dirge of The Cerberus, a spin-off game, it is revealed that the Lifestream can and will transplant itself from a planet when that place becomes too dangerous.\n\nComputer game \"Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri\" and its expansion \"Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire\" are set on the planet Chiron in the Alpha Centauri system where all indigenous life appears to behave in accordance with the Gaia philosophy. The intelligent force behind this behavior is called simply \"Planet\" and, in the expansion, is revealed to be artificially created by an alien race. At the time the game takes place, Planet is nearing its self-awareness threshold. Normally, the nature of Planet's life causes it never to attain full sentience; however, human presence adds an unknown variable into the equation.\n\nThe Gaia philosophy is a guiding principle for terrorists in the Tom Clancy novel \"Rainbow Six\".\n\nThe film \"Avatar\" depicts a world (Pandora) that functions like a single organism, in which various species of earth and sky cooperate with the humanoid population (the Na'vi) to defend the planet against a corporate-military invasion.\n\n\n\n", "id": "12393", "title": "Gaia philosophy"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12395", "text": "Greenhouse effect\n\nThe greenhouse effect is the process by which radiation from a planet's atmosphere warms the planet's surface to a temperature above what it would be without its atmosphere.\n\nIf a planet's atmosphere contains radiatively active gases (i.e., greenhouse gases) the atmosphere will radiate energy in all directions. Part of this radiation is directed towards the surface, warming it. The downward component of this radiation â that is, the strength of the greenhouse effect â will depend on the atmosphere's temperature and on the amount of greenhouse gases that the atmosphere contains.\n\nOn Earth, the atmosphere is warmed by absorption of infrared thermal radiation from the underlying surface (heated by the sun), absorption of shorter wavelength radiant energy from the sun, and convective heat fluxes from the surface. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere radiate energy, some of which is directed to the surface and lower atmosphere. The mechanism that produces this difference between the actual surface temperature and the effective temperature is due to the atmosphere and is known as the greenhouse effect.\n\nEarthâs natural greenhouse effect is critical to supporting life. Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests, have intensified the natural greenhouse effect, causing global warming.\n\nThe mechanism is named after a faulty analogy with the effect of solar radiation passing through glass and warming a greenhouse. The way a greenhouse retains heat is fundamentally different, as a greenhouse works by reducing airflow and retaining warm air inside the structure.\n\nThe existence of the greenhouse effect was argued for by Joseph Fourier in 1824. The argument and the evidence were further strengthened by Claude Pouillet in 1827 and 1838 and reasoned from experimental observations by John Tyndall in 1859. The effect was more fully quantified by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. However, the term \"greenhouse\" was not used to refer to this effect by any of these scientists; the term was first used in this way by Nils Gustaf Ekholm in 1901.\n\nIn 1917 Alexander Graham Bell wrote \"[The unchecked burning of fossil fuels] would have a sort of greenhouse effect\", and \"The net result is the greenhouse becomes a sort of hot-house.\" Bell went on to also advocate the use of alternate energy sources, such as solar energy.\n\nEarth receives energy from the Sun in the form of ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared radiation. Of the total amount of solar energy available at the top of the atmosphere, about 26% is reflected to space by the atmosphere and clouds and 19% is absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds. Most of the remaining energy is absorbed at the surface of Earth. Because the Earth's surface is colder than the photosphere of the Sun, it radiates at wavelengths that are much longer than the wavelengths that were absorbed. Most of this thermal radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere, thereby warming it. In addition to the absorption of solar and thermal radiation, the atmosphere further gains heat by sensible and latent heat fluxes from the surface. The atmosphere radiates energy both upwards and downwards; the part radiated downwards is absorbed by the surface of Earth. This leads to a higher equilibrium temperature than if the atmosphere were absent.\n\nAn ideal thermally conductive blackbody at the same distance from the Sun as Earth would have a temperature of about 5.3Â Â°C. However, because Earth reflects about 30% of the incoming sunlight, this idealized planet's effective temperature (the temperature of a blackbody that would emit the same amount of radiation) would be about â18Â Â°C. The surface temperature of this hypothetical planet is 33Â Â°C below Earth's actual surface temperature of approximately 14Â Â°C.\n\nThe basic mechanism can be qualified in a number of ways, none of which affect the fundamental process. The atmosphere near the surface is largely opaque to thermal radiation (with important exceptions for \"window\" bands), and most heat loss from the surface is by sensible heat and latent heat transport. Radiative energy losses become increasingly important higher in the atmosphere, largely because of the decreasing concentration of water vapor, an important greenhouse gas. It is more realistic to think of the greenhouse effect as applying to a \"surface\" in the mid-troposphere, which is effectively coupled to the surface by a lapse rate. The simple picture also assumes a steady state, but in the real world, there are variations due to the diurnal cycle as well as the seasonal cycle and weather disturbances. Solar heating only applies during daytime. During the night, the atmosphere cools somewhat, but not greatly, because its emissivity is low. Diurnal temperature changes decrease with height in the atmosphere.\n\nWithin the region where radiative effects are important, the description given by the idealized greenhouse model becomes realistic. Earth's surface, warmed to a temperature around 255Â K, radiates long-wavelength, infrared heat in the range of 4â100Â Î¼m. At these wavelengths, greenhouse gases that were largely transparent to incoming solar radiation are more absorbent. Each layer of atmosphere with greenhouses gases absorbs some of the heat being radiated upwards from lower layers. It reradiates in all directions, both upwards and downwards; in equilibrium (by definition) the same amount as it has absorbed. This results in more warmth below. Increasing the concentration of the gases increases the amount of absorption and reradiation, and thereby further warms the layers and ultimately the surface below.\n\nGreenhouse gasesâincluding most diatomic gases with two different atoms (such as carbon monoxide, CO) and all gases with three or more atomsâare able to absorb and emit infrared radiation. Though more than 99% of the dry atmosphere is IR transparent (because the main constituentsâN, O, and Arâare not able to directly absorb or emit infrared radiation), intermolecular collisions cause the energy absorbed and emitted by the greenhouse gases to be shared with the other, non-IR-active, gases.\n\nBy their percentage contribution to the greenhouse effect on Earth the four major gases are:\n\nIt is not physically realistic to assign a specific percentage to each gas because the absorption and emission bands of the gases overlap (hence the ranges given above). The major non-gas contributor to Earth's greenhouse effect, clouds, also absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus have an effect on the radiative properties of the atmosphere.\n\nStrengthening of the greenhouse effect through human activities is known as the enhanced (or anthropogenic) greenhouse effect. This increase in radiative forcing from human activity is attributable mainly to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. According to the latest Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \"\"atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers, have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century\"\".\n\nCO is produced by fossil fuel burning and other activities such as cement production and tropical deforestation. Measurements of CO from the Mauna Loa observatory show that concentrations have increased from about 313 parts per million (ppm) in 1960 to about 389 ppm in 2010. It reached the 400 ppm milestone on May 9, 2013. The current observed amount of CO exceeds the geological record maxima (~300 ppm) from ice core data. The effect of combustion-produced carbon dioxide on the global climate, a special case of the greenhouse effect first described in 1896 by Svante Arrhenius, has also been called the Callendar effect.\n\nOver the past 800,000 years, ice core data shows that carbon dioxide has varied from values as low as 180 ppm to the pre-industrial level of 270 ppm. Paleoclimatologists consider variations in carbon dioxide concentration to be a fundamental factor influencing climate variations over this time scale.\n\nThe \"greenhouse effect\" of the atmosphere is named by analogy to greenhouses which become warmer in sunlight. The explanation given in most sources for the warmer temperature in an actual greenhouse is that incident solar radiation in the visible, long-wavelength ultraviolet and short-wavelength infrared range of the spectrum passes through the glass roof and walls and is absorbed by the floor, earth, and contents, which become warmer and re-emit the energy as longer-wavelength infrared radiation. Glass and other materials used for greenhouse walls do not transmit infrared radiation, so the infrared cannot escape via radiative transfer. As the structure is not open to the atmosphere, heat also cannot escape via convection, so the temperature inside the greenhouse rises. The greenhouse effect, due to infrared-opaque \"greenhouse gases\" including carbon dioxide and methane instead of glass, also affects Earth as a whole; there is no convective cooling because no significant amount of air escapes from Earth.\n\nHowever, the mechanism by which the atmosphere retains heatâthe \"greenhouse effect\"âis different; a greenhouse is not primarily warmed by the \"greenhouse effect\".\nA greenhouse works primarily by allowing sunlight to warm surfaces inside the structure, but then preventing absorbed heat from leaving the structure through convection. The \"greenhouse effect\" heats Earth because greenhouse gases absorb outgoing radiative energy, heating the atmosphere which then emits radiative energy with some of it going back towards Earth.\n\nA greenhouse is built of any material that passes sunlight, usually glass, or plastic. It mainly warms up because the sun warms the ground and contents inside, which then warms the air in the greenhouse. The air continues to heat up because it is confined within the greenhouse, unlike the environment outside the greenhouse where warm air near the surface rises and mixes with cooler air aloft. This can be demonstrated by opening a small window near the roof of a greenhouse: the temperature will drop considerably. It was demonstrated experimentally (R. W. Wood, 1909) that a \"greenhouse\" with a cover of rock salt (which is transparent to infrared) heats up an enclosure similarly to one with a glass cover. Thus greenhouses work primarily by preventing convective cooling.\n\nMore recent quantitative studies suggest that the effect of infrared radiative cooling is not negligibly small, and may have economic implications in a heated greenhouse. Analysis of issues of near-infrared radiation in a greenhouse with screens of a high coefficient of reflection concluded that installation of such screens reduced heat demand by about 8%, and application of dyes to transparent surfaces was suggested. Composite less-reflective glass, or less effective but cheaper anti-reflective coated simple glass, also produced savings.\n\nIn the Solar System, there are also greenhouse effects on Mars, Venus, and Titan. The greenhouse effect on Venus is particularly large because its dense atmosphere consisting mainly of carbon dioxide. Titan has an anti-greenhouse effect, in that its atmosphere absorbs solar radiation but is relatively transparent to infrared radiation. Pluto is also colder than would be expected because evaporation of nitrogen cools it.\n\nA runaway greenhouse effect occurs if positive feedbacks lead to the evaporation of all greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. A runaway greenhouse effect involving carbon dioxide and water vapor is thought to have occurred on Venus.\n\n\n\n", "id": "12395", "title": "Greenhouse effect"}

A more recent trend is to write group homomorphisms on the right of their arguments, omitting brackets, so that \"h\"(\"x\") becomes simply \"x h\". This approach is especially prevalent in areas of group theory where automata play a role, since it accords better with the convention that automata read words from left to right.\n\nIn areas of mathematics where one considers groups endowed with additional structure, a \"homomorphism\" sometimes means a map which respects not only the group structure (as above) but also the extra structure. For example, a homomorphism of topological groups is often required to be continuous.\n\nThe purpose of defining a group homomorphism is to create functions that preserve the algebraic structure. An equivalent definition of group homomorphism is: The function \"h\" : \"G\" â \"H\" is a group homomorphism if whenever \"a\" â \"b\" = \"c\" we have \"h\"(\"a\") â \"h\"(\"b\") = \"h\"(\"c\"). In other words, the group \"H\" in some sense has a similar algebraic structure as \"G\" and the homomorphism \"h\" preserves that.\n\n\nWe define the \"kernel of h\" to be the set of elements in \"G\" which are mapped to the identity in \"H\"\n\nand the \"image of h\" to be\n\nThe kernel and image of a homomorphism can be interpreted as measuring how close it is to being an isomorphism. The first isomorphism theorem states that the image of a group homomorphism, \"h\"(\"G\") is isomorphic to the quotient group \"G\"/ker \"h\".\n\nThe kernel of h is a normal subgroup of \"G\" and the image of h is a subgroup of \"H\":\n\nIf and only if }, the homomorphism, \"h\", is a \"group monomorphism\"; i.e., \"h\" is injective (one-to-one). Injection directly gives that there is a unique element in the kernel, and a unique element in the kernel gives injection:\n\n\n\nIf and are group homomorphisms, then so is . This shows that the class of all groups, together with group homomorphisms as morphisms, forms a category.\n\nIf \"G\" and \"H\" are abelian (i.e., commutative) groups, then the set of all group homomorphisms from \"G\" to \"H\" is itself an abelian group: the sum of two homomorphisms is defined by\nThe commutativity of \"H\" is needed to prove that is again a group homomorphism.\n\nThe addition of homomorphisms is compatible with the composition of homomorphisms in the following sense: if \"f\" is in , \"h\", \"k\" are elements of , and \"g\" is in , then \nSince the composition is associative, this shows that the set End(\"G\") of all endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a ring, the \"endomorphism ring\" of \"G\". For example, the endomorphism ring of the abelian group consisting of the direct sum of \"m\" copies of Z/\"nZ is isomorphic to the ring of \"m\"-by-\"m\" matrices with entries in Z/\"nZ. The above compatibility also shows that the category of all abelian groups with group homomorphisms forms a preadditive category; the existence of direct sums and well-behaved kernels makes this category the prototypical example of an abelian category.\n\n\n", "id": "12396", "title": "Group homomorphism"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12397", "text": "Group isomorphism\n\nIn abstract algebra, a group isomorphism is a function between two groups that sets up a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the groups in a way that respects the given group operations. If there exists an isomorphism between two groups, then the groups are called isomorphic. From the standpoint of group theory, isomorphic groups have the same properties and need not be distinguished.\n\nGiven two groups (G, â) and (H, formula_1), a \"group isomorphism\" from (G, â) to (H, formula_1) is a bijective group homomorphism from G to H. Spelled out, this means that a group isomorphism is a bijective function formula_3 such that for all u and v in G it holds that\n\nThe two groups (G, â) and (H, formula_1) are isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism from one to the other. This is written:\n\nOften shorter and simpler notations can be used. When the relevant group operations are unambiguous they are omitted and one writes:\n\nSometimes one can even simply write G = H. Whether such a notation is possible without confusion or ambiguity depends on context. For example, the equals sign is not very suitable when the groups are both subgroups of the same group. See also the examples.\n\nConversely, given a group (G, â), a set H, and a bijection formula_3, we can make H a group (H, formula_1) by defining\n\nIf H = G and formula_1 = â then the bijection is an automorphism (\"q.v.\").\n\nIntuitively, group theorists view two isomorphic groups as follows: For every element \"g\" of a group \"G\", there exists an element \"h\" of \"H\" such that \"h\" 'behaves in the same way' as \"g\" (operates with other elements of the group in the same way as \"g\"). For instance, if \"g\" generates \"G\", then so does \"h\". This implies in particular that \"G\" and \"H\" are in bijective correspondence. Thus, the definition of an isomorphism is quite natural.\n\nAn isomorphism of groups may equivalently be defined as an invertible morphism in the category of groups, where invertible here means has a two-sided inverse.\n\n\nAn isomorphism is given by\nfor every x in formula_12.\n\n\nSome groups can be proven to be isomorphic, relying on the axiom of choice, but the proof does not indicate how to construct a concrete isomorphism. Examples:\n\n\nAll cyclic groups of a given order are isomorphic to formula_33.\n\nLet \"G\" be a cyclic group and \"n\" be the order of \"G\". \"G\" is then the group generated by formula_34. \nWe will show that\n\nDefine \nThen\n\nFrom the definition, it follows that any isomorphism formula_3 will map the identity element of G to the identity element of H, \nthat it will map inverses to inverses,\nand more generally, \"n\"th powers to \"n\"th powers,\nfor all u in G,\nand that the inverse map formula_45 is also a group isomorphism.\n\nThe relation \"being isomorphic\" satisfies all the axioms of an equivalence relation. If f is an isomorphism between two groups G and H, then everything that is true about G that is only related to the group structure can be translated via f into a true ditto statement about H, and vice versa.\n\nAn isomorphism from a group (G, â) to itself is called an automorphism of this group. Thus it is a bijection formula_46 such that\n\nAn automorphism always maps the identity to itself. The image under an automorphism of a conjugacy class is always a conjugacy class (the same or another). The image of an element has the same order as that element.\n\nThe composition of two automorphisms is again an automorphism, and with this operation the set of all automorphisms of a group G, denoted by Aut(G), forms itself a group, the \"automorphism group\" of G.\n\nFor all abelian groups there is at least the automorphism that replaces the group elements by their inverses. However, in groups where all elements are equal to their inverse this is the trivial automorphism, e.g. in the Klein four-group. For that group all permutations of the three non-identity elements are automorphisms, so the automorphism group is isomorphic to S and Dih.\n\nIn Z for a prime number p, one non-identity element can be replaced by any other, with corresponding changes in the other elements. The automorphism group is isomorphic to . For example, for , multiplying all elements of Z by 3, modulo 7, is an automorphism of order 6 in the automorphism group, because , while lower powers do not give 1. Thus this automorphism generates Z. There is one more automorphism with this property: multiplying all elements of Z by 5, modulo 7. Therefore, these two correspond to the elements 1 and 5 of Z, in that order or conversely.\n\nThe automorphism group of Z is isomorphic to Z, because only each of the two elements 1 and 5 generate Z, so apart from the identity we can only interchange these.\n\nThe automorphism group of has order 168, as can be found as follows. All 7 non-identity elements play the same role, so we can choose which plays the role of (1,0,0). Any of the remaining 6 can be chosen to play the role of (0,1,0). This determines which corresponds to (1,1,0). For (0,0,1) we can choose from 4, which determines the rest. Thus we have automorphisms. They correspond to those of the Fano plane, of which the 7 points correspond to the 7 non-identity elements. The lines connecting three points correspond to the group operation: \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" on one line means , , and . See also general linear group over finite fields.\n\nFor abelian groups all automorphisms except the trivial one are called outer automorphisms.\n\nNon-abelian groups have a non-trivial inner automorphism group, and possibly also outer automorphisms.\n\n\n", "id": "12397", "title": "Group isomorphism"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12398", "text": "Geographic information system\n\nA geographic information system (or GIS) is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present spatial or geographic data. The acronym GIS is sometimes used for geographic information science (GIScience) to refer to the academic discipline that studies geographic information systems and is a large domain within the broader academic discipline of geoinformatics. What goes beyond a GIS is a spatial data infrastructure, a concept that has no such restrictive boundaries.\n\nIn general, the term describes any information system that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes, shares, and displays geographic information. GIS applications are tools that allow users to create interactive queries (user-created searches), analyze spatial information, edit data in maps, and present the results of all these operations. Geographic information science is the science underlying geographic concepts, applications, and systems.\n\nGIS is a broad term that can refer to a number of different technologies, processes, and methods. It is attached to many operations and has many applications related to engineering, planning, management, transport/logistics, insurance, telecommunications, and business. For that reason, GIS and location intelligence applications can be the foundation for many location-enabled services that rely on analysis and visualization.\n\nGIS can relate unrelated information by using location as the key index variable. Locations or extents in the Earth spaceâtime may be recorded as dates/times of occurrence, and x, y, and z coordinates representing, longitude, latitude, and elevation, respectively. All Earth-based spatialâtemporal location and extent references should be relatable to one another and ultimately to a \"real\" physical location or extent. This key characteristic of GIS has begun to open new avenues of scientific inquiry.\n\nThe first known use of the term \"geographic information system\" was by Roger Tomlinson in the year 1968 in his paper \"A Geographic Information System for Regional Planning\". Tomlinson is also acknowledged as the \"father of GIS\".\nPreviously, one of the first applications of spatial analysis in epidemiology is the 1832 \"\"Rapport sur la marche et les effets du cholÃ©ra dans Paris et le dÃ©partement de la Seine\"\". The French geographer Charles Picquet represented the 48Â districts of the city of Paris by halftone color gradient according to the number of deaths by cholera perÂ 1,000Â inhabitants. In 1854 John Snow determined the source of a cholera outbreak in London by marking points on a map depicting where the cholera victims lived, and connecting the cluster that he found with a nearby water source. This was one of the earliest successful uses of a geographic methodology in epidemiology. While the basic elements of topography and theme existed previously in cartography, the John Snow map was unique, using cartographic methods not only to depict but also to analyze clusters of geographically dependent phenomena.\n\nThe earlyÂ 20thÂ century saw the development of photozincography, which allowed maps to be split into layers, for example one layer for vegetation and another for water. This was particularly used for printing contoursÂ â drawing these was a labour-intensive task but having them on a separate layer meant they could be worked on without the other layers to confuse the draughtsman. This work was originally drawn on glass plates but later plastic film was introduced, with the advantages of being lighter, using less storage space and being less brittle, among others. When all the layers were finished, they were combined into one image using a large process camera. Once color printing came in, the layers idea was also used for creating separate printing plates for each color. While the use of layers much later became one of the main typical features of a contemporary GIS, the photographic process just described is not considered to be a GIS in itselfÂ â as the maps were just images with no database to link them to.\n\nComputer hardware development spurred by nuclear weapon research led to general-purpose computer \"mapping\" applications by the early 1960s.\n\nThe year 1960 saw the development of the world's first true operational GIS in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada by the federal Department of Forestry and Rural Development. Developed by Dr. Roger Tomlinson, it was called the Canada Geographic Information SystemÂ (CGIS) and was used to store, analyze, and manipulate data collected for the Canada Land InventoryÂ â an effort to determine the land capability for rural Canada by mapping information about soils, agriculture, recreation, wildlife, waterfowl, forestry and land use at a scale of 1:50,000. A rating classification factor was also added to permit analysis.\n\nCGIS was an improvement over \"computer mapping\" applications as it provided capabilities for overlay, measurement, and digitizing/scanning. It supported a national coordinate system that spanned the continent, coded lines as arcs having a true embedded topology and it stored the attribute and locational information in separate files. As a result of this, Tomlinson has become known as the \"father of GIS\", particularly for his use of overlays in promoting the spatial analysis of convergent geographic data.\n\nCGIS lasted into the 1990s and built a large digital land resource database in Canada. It was developed as a mainframe-based system in support of federal and provincial resource planning and management. Its strength was continent-wide analysis of complex datasets. The CGIS was never available commercially.\n\nInÂ 1964 Howard T. Fisher formed the Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis at the Harvard Graduate School of Design (LCGSA 1965â1991), where a number of important theoretical concepts in spatial data handling were developed, and which by the 1970s had distributed seminal software code and systems, such as SYMAP, GRID, and ODYSSEYÂ â that served as sources for subsequent commercial developmentâto universities, research centers and corporations worldwide.\n\nBy the late 1970s two public domain GIS systems (MOSS and GRASS GIS) were in development, and by the early 1980s, M&S Computing (later Intergraph) along with Bentley Systems Incorporated for the CADÂ platform, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), CARISÂ (Computer Aided Resource Information System), MapInfo Corporation and ERDASÂ (Earth Resource Data Analysis System) emerged as commercial vendors of GISÂ software, successfully incorporating many of the CGISÂ features, combining the first generation approach to separation of spatial and attribute information with a second generation approach to organizing attribute data into database structures.\n\nIn 1986, Mapping Display and Analysis System (MIDAS), the first desktop GIS product was released for the DOS operating system. This was renamed in 1990 to MapInfo for Windows when it was ported to the Microsoft Windows platform. This began the process of moving GIS from the research department into the business environment.\n\nBy the end of the 20thÂ century, the rapid growth in various systems had been consolidated and standardized on relatively few platforms and users were beginning to explore viewing GISÂ data over the Internet, requiring data format and transfer standards. More recently, a growing number of free, open-source GIS packages run on a range of operating systems and can be customized to perform specific tasks. Increasingly geospatial data and mapping applications are being made available via the world wide web.\n\nSeveral articles on the history of GIS have been published.\n\nModern GIS technologies use digital information, for which various digitized data creation methods are used. The most common method of data creation is digitization, where a hard copy map or survey plan is transferred into a digital medium through the use of a CAD program, and geo-referencing capabilities. With the wide availability of ortho-rectified imagery (from satellites, aircraft, Helikites and UAVs), heads-up digitizing is becoming the main avenue through which geographic data is extracted. Heads-up digitizing involves the tracing of geographic data directly on top of the aerial imagery instead of by the traditional method of tracing the geographic form on a separate digitizing tablet (heads-down digitizing).\n\nGIS uses spatio-temporal (space-time) location as the key index variable for all other information. Just as a relational database containing text or numbers can relate many different tables using common key index variables, GIS can relate otherwise unrelated information by using location as the key index variable. The key is the location and/or extent in space-time.\n\nAny variable that can be located spatially, and increasingly also temporally, can be referenced using a GIS. Locations or extents in Earth spaceâtime may be recorded as dates/times of occurrence, and x, y, and z coordinates representing, longitude, latitude, and elevation, respectively. These GIS coordinates may represent other quantified systems of temporo-spatial reference (for example, film frame number, stream gage station, highway mile-marker, surveyor benchmark, building address, street intersection, entrance gate, water depth sounding, POS or CAD drawing origin/units). Units applied to recorded temporal-spatial data can vary widely (even when using exactly the same data, see map projections), but all Earth-based spatialâtemporal location and extent references should, ideally, be relatable to one another and ultimately to a \"real\" physical location or extent in spaceâtime.\n\nRelated by accurate spatial information, an incredible variety of real-world and projected past or future data can be analyzed, interpreted and represented. This key characteristic of GIS has begun to open new avenues of scientific inquiry into behaviors and patterns of real-world information that previously had not been systematically correlated.\n\nGIS accuracy depends upon source data, and how it is encoded to be data referenced. Land surveyors have been able to provide a high level of positional accuracy utilizing the GPS-derived positions. High-resolution digital terrain and aerial imagery, powerful computers and Web technology are changing the quality, utility, and expectations of GIS to serve society on a grand scale, but nevertheless there are other source data that affect overall GIS accuracy like paper maps, though these may be of limited use in achieving the desired accuracy.\n\nIn developing a digital topographic database for a GIS, topographical maps are the main source, and aerial photography and satellite imagery are extra sources for collecting data and identifying attributes which can be mapped in layers over a location facsimile of scale. The scale of a map and geographical rendering area representation type are very important aspects since the information content depends mainly on the scale set and resulting locatability of the map's representations. In order to digitize a map, the map has to be checked within theoretical dimensions, then scanned into a raster format, and resulting raster data has to be given a theoretical dimension by a rubber sheeting/warping technology process.\n\nA quantitative analysis of maps brings accuracy issues into focus. The electronic and other equipment used to make measurements for GIS is far more precise than the machines of conventional map analysis. All geographical data are inherently inaccurate, and these inaccuracies will propagate through GISÂ operations in ways that are difficult to predict.\n\nGIS data represents real objects (such as roads, land use, elevation, trees, waterways, etc.) with digital data determining the mix. Real objects can be divided into two abstractions: discrete objects (e.g., a house) and continuous fields (such as rainfall amount, or elevations). Traditionally, there are two broad methods used to store data in a GIS for both kinds of abstractions mapping references: raster images and vector. Points, lines, and polygons are the stuff of mapped location attribute references. A new hybrid method of storing data is that of identifying point clouds, which combine three-dimensional points with RGB information at each point, returning a \"3D color image\". GIS thematic maps then are becoming more and more realistically visually descriptive of what they set out to show or determine.\n\nFor a list of popular GIS file formats, such as shapefiles, see .\n\nData captureâentering information into the systemâconsumes much of the time of GISÂ practitioners. There are a variety of methods used to enter data into a GIS where it is stored in a digital format.\n\nExisting data printed on paper or PET film maps can be digitized or scanned to produce digital data. A digitizer produces vector data as an operator traces points, lines, and polygon boundaries from a map. Scanning a map results in raster data that could be further processed to produce vector data.\n\nSurvey data can be directly entered into a GIS from digital data collection systems on survey instruments using a technique called coordinate geometry (COGO). Positions from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) like Global Positioning System can also be collected and then imported into a GIS. A current trend in data collection gives users the ability to utilize field computers with the ability to edit live data using wireless connections or disconnected editing sessions. This has been enhanced by the availability of low-cost mapping-grade GPS units with decimeter accuracy in real time. This eliminates the need to post process, import, and update the data in the office after fieldwork has been collected. This includes the ability to incorporate positions collected using a laser rangefinder. New technologies also allow users to create maps as well as analysis directly in the field, making projects more efficient and mapping more accurate.\n\nRemotely sensed data also plays an important role in data collection and consist of sensors attached to a platform. Sensors include cameras, digital scanners and lidar, while platforms usually consist of aircraft and satellites. In England in the mid 1990s, hybrid kite/balloons called Helikites first pioneered the use of compact airborne digital cameras as airborne Geo-Information Systems. Aircraft measurement software, accurate to 0.4Â mm was used to link the photographs and measure the ground. Helikites are inexpensive and gather more accurate data than aircraft. Helikites can be used over roads, railways and towns where UAVs are banned.\n\nRecently with the development of miniature UAVs, aerial data collection is becoming possible with them. For example, the Aeryon Scout was used to map a 50-acreÂ area with a Ground sample distance of in only 12Â minutes.\n\nThe majority of digital data currently comes from photo interpretation of aerial photographs. Soft-copy workstations are used to digitize features directly from stereo pairs of digital photographs. These systems allow data to be captured in two and three dimensions, with elevations measured directly from a stereo pair using principles of photogrammetry. Analog aerial photos must be scanned before being entered into a soft-copy system, for high-quality digital cameras this step is skipped.\n\nSatellite remote sensing provides another important source of spatial data. Here satellites use different sensor packages to passively measure the reflectance from parts of the electromagnetic spectrum or radio waves that were sent out from an active sensor such as radar. Remote sensing collects raster data that can be further processed using different bands to identify objects and classes of interest, such as land cover.\n\nWhen data is captured, the user should consider if the data should be captured with either a relative accuracy or absolute accuracy, since this could not only influence how information will be interpreted but also the cost of data capture.\n\nAfter entering data into a GIS, the data usually requires editing, to remove errors, or further processing. For vector data it must be made \"topologically correct\" before it can be used for some advanced analysis. For example, in a road network, lines must connect with nodes at an intersection. Errors such as undershoots and overshoots must also be removed. For scanned maps, blemishes on the source map may need to be removed from the resulting raster. For example, a fleck of dirt might connect two lines that should not be connected.\n\nData restructuring can be performed by a GIS to convert data into different formats. For example, a GIS may be used to convert a satellite image map to a vector structure by generating lines around all cells with the same classification, while determining the cell spatial relationships, such as adjacency or inclusion.\n\nMore advanced data processing can occur with image processing, a technique developed in the lateÂ 1960s by NASA and the private sector to provide contrast enhancement, false color rendering and a variety of other techniques including use of two dimensional Fourier transforms. Since digital data is collected and stored in various ways, the two data sources may not be entirely compatible. So a GIS must be able to convert geographic data from one structure to another. In so doing, the implicit assumptions behind different ontologies and classifications require analysis. Object ontologies have gained increasing prominence as a consequence of object-oriented programming and sustained work by Barry Smith and co-workers.\n\nThe earth can be represented by various models, each of which may provide a different set of coordinates (e.g., latitude, longitude, elevation) for any given point on the Earth's surface. The simplest model is to assume the earth is a perfect sphere. As more measurements of the earth have accumulated, the models of the earth have become more sophisticated and more accurate. In fact, there are models called datums that apply to different areas of the earth to provide increased accuracy, like NAD83 for U.S. measurements, and the World Geodetic System for worldwide measurements.\n\nGIS spatial analysis is a rapidly changing field, and GIS packages are increasingly including analytical tools as standard built-in facilities, as optional toolsets, as add-ins or 'analysts'. In many instances these are provided by the original software suppliers (commercial vendors or collaborative non commercial development teams), while in other cases facilities have been developed and are provided by third parties. Furthermore, many products offer software development kits (SDKs), programming languages and language support, scripting facilities and/or special interfaces for developing one's own analytical tools or variants. The website \"Geospatial Analysis\" and associated book/ebook attempt to provide a reasonably comprehensive guide to the subject. The increased availability has created a new dimension to business intelligence termed \"spatial intelligence\" which, when openly delivered via intranet, democratizes access to geographic and social network data. Geospatial intelligence, based on GIS spatial analysis, has also become a key element for security. GIS as a whole can be described as conversion to a vectorial representation or to any other digitisation process.\n\nSlope can be defined as the steepness or gradient of a unit of terrain, usually measured as an angle in degrees or as a percentage. Aspect can be defined as the direction in which a unit of terrain faces. Aspect is usually expressed in degrees from north. Slope, aspect, and surface curvature in terrain analysis are all derived from neighborhood operations using elevation values of a cell's adjacent neighbours. Slope is a function of resolution, and the spatial resolution used to calculate slope and aspect should always be specified. Authors such as Skidmore, Jones and Zhou and Liu have compared techniques for calculating slope and aspect.\n\nThe following method can be used to derive slope and aspect:\nThe elevation at a point or unit of terrain will have perpendicular tangents (slope) passing through the point, in an east-west and north-south direction. These two tangents give two components, âz/âx and âz/ây, which then be used to determine the overall direction of slope, and the aspect of the slope. The gradient is defined as a vector quantity with components equal to the partial derivatives of the surface in the x and y directions.\n\nThe calculation of the overall 3x3 grid slope \"S\" and aspect \"A\" for methods that determine east-west and north-south component use the following formulas respectively:\nformula_1\nformula_2\n\nZhou and Liu describe another formula for calculating aspect, as follows:\nformula_3\n\nIt is difficult to relate wetlands maps to rainfall amounts recorded at different points such as airports, television stations, and schools. A GIS, however, can be used to depict two- and three-dimensional characteristics of the Earth's surface, subsurface, and atmosphere from information points. For example, a GIS can quickly generate a map with isopleth or contour lines that indicate differing amounts of rainfall. Such a map can be thought of as a rainfall contour map. Many sophisticated methods can estimate the characteristics of surfaces from a limited number of point measurements. A two-dimensional contour map created from the surface modeling of rainfall point measurements may be overlaid and analyzed with any other map in a GIS covering the same area. This GIS derived map can then provide additional information - such as the viability of water power potential as a renewable energy source. Similarly, GIS can be used to compare other renewable energy resources to find the best geographic potential for a region.\n\nAdditionally, from a series of three-dimensional points, or digital elevation model, isopleth lines representing elevation contours can be generated, along with slope analysis, shaded relief, and other elevation products. Watersheds can be easily defined for any given reach, by computing all of the areas contiguous and uphill from any given point of interest. Similarly, an expected thalweg of where surface water would want to travel in intermittent and permanent streams can be computed from elevation data in the GIS.\n\nA GIS can recognize and analyze the spatial relationships that exist within digitally stored spatial data. These topological relationships allow complex spatial modelling and analysis to be performed. Topological relationships between geometric entities traditionally include adjacency (what adjoins what), containment (what encloses what), and proximity (how close something is to something else).\n\nGeometric networks are linear networks of objects that can be used to represent interconnected features, and to perform special spatial analysis on them. A geometric network is composed of edges, which are connected at junction points, similar to graphs in mathematics and computer science. Just like graphs, networks can have weight and flow assigned to its edges, which can be used to represent various interconnected features more accurately. Geometric networks are often used to model road networks and public utility networks, such as electric, gas, and water networks. Network modeling is also commonly employed in transportation planning, hydrology modeling, and infrastructure modeling.\n\nGIS hydrological models can provide a spatial element that other hydrological models lack, with the analysis of variables such as slope, aspect and watershed or catchment area. Terrain analysis is fundamental to hydrology, since water always flows down a slope. As basic terrain analysis of a digital elevation model (DEM) involves calculation of slope and aspect, DEMs are very useful for hydrological analysis. Slope and aspect can then be used to determine direction of surface runoff, and hence flow accumulation for the formation of streams, rivers and lakes. Areas of divergent flow can also give a clear indication of the boundaries of a catchment. Once a flow direction and accumulation matrix has been created, queries can be performed that show contributing or dispersal areas at a certain point. More detail can be added to the model, such as terrain roughness, vegetation types and soil types, which can influence infiltration and evapotranspiration rates, and hence influencing surface flow. One of the main uses of hydrological modeling is in environmental contamination research.\n\nDana Tomlin probably coined the term \"cartographic modeling\" in his PhD dissertation (1983); he later used it in the title of his book, \"Geographic Information Systems and Cartographic Modeling\" (1990).\nCartographic modeling refers to a process where several thematic layers of the same area are produced, processed, and analyzed. Tomlin used raster layers, but the overlay method (see below) can be used more generally. Operations on map layers can be combined into algorithms, and eventually into simulation or optimization models.\n\nThe combination of several spatial datasets (points, lines, or polygons) creates a new output vector dataset, visually similar to stacking several maps of the same region. These overlays are similar to mathematical Venn diagram overlays. A union overlay combines the geographic features and attribute tables of both inputs into a single new output. An intersect overlay defines the area where both inputs overlap and retains a set of attribute fields for each. A symmetric difference overlay defines an output area that includes the total area of both inputs except for the overlapping area.\n\nData extraction is a GIS process similar to vector overlay, though it can be used in either vector or raster data analysis. Rather than combining the properties and features of both datasets, data extraction involves using a \"clip\" or \"mask\" to extract the features of one data set that fall within the spatial extent of another dataset.\n\nIn raster data analysis, the overlay of datasets is accomplished through a process known as \"local operation on multiple rasters\" or \"map algebra,\" through a function that combines the values of each raster's matrix. This function may weigh some inputs more than others through use of an \"index model\" that reflects the influence of various factors upon a geographic phenomenon.\n\nGeostatistics is a branch of statistics that deals with field data, spatial data with a continuous index. It provides methods to model spatial correlation, and predict values at arbitrary locations (interpolation).\n\nWhen phenomena are measured, the observation methods dictate the accuracy of any subsequent analysis. Due to the nature of the data (e.g. traffic patterns in an urban environment; weather patterns over the Pacific Ocean), a constant or dynamic degree of precision is always lost in the measurement. This loss of precision is determined from the scale and distribution of the data collection.\n\nTo determine the statistical relevance of the analysis, an average is determined so that points (gradients) outside of any immediate measurement can be included to determine their predicted behavior. This is due to the limitations of the applied statistic and data collection methods, and interpolation is required to predict the behavior of particles, points, and locations that are not directly measurable.\n\nInterpolation is the process by which a surface is created, usually a raster dataset, through the input of data collected at a number of sample points. There are several forms of interpolation, each which treats the data differently, depending on the properties of the data set. In comparing interpolation methods, the first consideration should be whether or not the source data will change (exact or approximate). Next is whether the method is subjective, a human interpretation, or objective. Then there is the nature of transitions between points: are they abrupt or gradual. Finally, there is whether a method is global (it uses the entire data set to form the model), or local where an algorithm is repeated for a small section of terrain.\n\nInterpolation is a justified measurement because of a spatial autocorrelation principle that recognizes that data collected at any position will have a great similarity to, or influence of those locations within its immediate vicinity.\n\nDigital elevation models, triangulated irregular networks, edge-finding algorithms, Thiessen polygons, Fourier analysis, (weighted) moving averages, inverse distance weighting, kriging, spline, and trend surface analysis are all mathematical methods to produce interpolative data.\n\nGeocoding is interpolating spatial locations (X,Y coordinates) from street addresses or any other spatially referenced data such as ZIPÂ Codes, parcel lots and address locations. A reference theme is required to geocode individual addresses, such as a road centerline file with address ranges. The individual address locations have historically been interpolated, or estimated, by examining address ranges along a road segment. These are usually provided in the form of a table or database. The software will then place a dot approximately where that address belongs along the segment of centerline. For example, an address point of 500 will be at the midpoint of a line segment that starts with addressÂ 1 and ends with addressÂ 1,000. Geocoding can also be applied against actual parcel data, typically from municipal tax maps. In this case, the result of the geocoding will be an actually positioned space as opposed to an interpolated point. This approach is being increasingly used to provide more precise location information.\n\nReverse geocoding is the process of returning an estimated street address number as it relates to a given coordinate. For example, a user can click on a road centerline theme (thus providing a coordinate) and have information returned that reflects the estimated house number. This house number is interpolated from a range assigned to that road segment. If the user clicks at the midpoint of a segment that starts with addressÂ 1 and ends withÂ 100, the returned value will be somewhere near 50. Note that reverse geocoding does not return actual addresses, only estimates of what should be there based on the predetermined range.\n\nCoupled with GIS, multi-criteria decision analysis methods support decision-makers in analysing a set of alternative spatial solutions, such as the most likely ecological habitat for restoration, against multiple criteria, such as vegetation cover or roads. MCDA uses decision rules to aggregate the criteria, which allows the alternative solutions to be ranked or prioritised. GIS MCDA may reduce costs and time involved in identifying potential restoration sites.\n\nCartography is the design and production of maps, or visual representations of spatial data. The vast majority of modern cartography is done with the help of computers, usually using GIS but production of quality cartography is also achieved by importing layers into a design program to refine it. Most GISÂ software gives the user substantial control over the appearance of the data.\n\nCartographic work serves two major functions:\n\nFirst, it produces graphics on the screen or on paper that convey the results of analysis to the people who make decisions about resources. Wall maps and other graphics can be generated, allowing the viewer to visualize and thereby understand the results of analyses or simulations of potential events. Web Map Servers facilitate distribution of generated maps through web browsers using various implementations of web-based application programming interfaces (AJAX, Java, Flash, etc.).\n\nSecond, other database information can be generated for further analysis or use. An example would be a list of all addresses within oneÂ mile (1.6Â km) of a toxic spill.\n\nTraditional maps are abstractions of the real world, a sampling of important elements portrayed on a sheet of paper with symbols to represent physical objects. People who use maps must interpret these symbols. Topographic maps show the shape of land surface with contour lines or with shaded relief.\n\nToday, graphic display techniques such as shading based on altitude in a GIS can make relationships among map elements visible, heightening one's ability to extract and analyze information. For example, two types of data were combined in a GIS to produce a perspective view of a portion of SanÂ Mateo County, California.\n\nA GIS was used to register and combine the two images to render the three-dimensional perspective view looking down the San Andreas Fault, using the Thematic Mapper image pixels, but shaded using the elevation of the landforms. The GISÂ display depends on the viewing point of the observer and time of day of the display, to properly render the shadows created by the sun's rays at that latitude, longitude, and time of day.\n\nAn archeochrome is a new way of displaying spatial data. It is a thematic on a 3DÂ map that is applied to a specific building or a part of a building. It is suited to the visual display of heat-loss data.\n\nSpatial ETL tools provide the data processing functionality of traditional Extract, Transform, LoadÂ (ETL) software, but with a primary focus on the ability to manage spatial data. They provide GISÂ users with the ability to translate data between different standards and proprietary formats, whilst geometrically transforming the data en route. These tools can come in the form of add-ins to existing wider-purpose software such as Microsoft Excel.\n\nGIS or spatial data mining is the application of data mining methods to spatial data. Data mining, which is the partially automated search for hidden patterns in large databases, offers great potential benefits for applied GIS-basedÂ decisionÂ making. Typical applications include environmental monitoring. A characteristic of such applications is that spatial correlation between data measurements require the use of specialized algorithms for more efficient data analysis.\n\nThe implementation of a GIS is often driven by jurisdictional (such as a city), purpose, or application requirements. Generally, a GIS implementation may be custom-designed for an organization. Hence, a GIS deployment developed for an application, jurisdiction, enterprise, or purpose may not be necessarily interoperable or compatible with a GIS that has been developed for some other application, jurisdiction, enterprise, or purpose.\n\nGIS provides, for every kind of location-based organization, a platform to update geographical data without wasting time to visit the field and update a database manually. GIS when integrated with other powerful enterprise solutions like SAP and the Wolfram Language helps creating powerful decision support system at enterprise level.\nMany disciplines can benefit from GISÂ technology. An active GISÂ market has resulted in lower costs and continual improvements in the hardware and software components of GIS, and usage in the fields of science, government, business, and industry, with applications including real estate, public health, crime mapping, national defense, sustainable development, natural resources, climatology, landscape architecture, archaeology, regional and community planning, transportation and logistics. GIS is also diverging into location-based services, which allows GPS-enabled mobile devices to display their location in relation to fixed objects (nearest restaurant, gas station, fire hydrant) or mobile objects (friends, children, policeÂ car), or to relay their position back to a central server for display or other processing.\n\nThe Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international industry consortium of 384Â companies, government agencies, universities, and individuals participating in a consensus process to develop publicly available geoprocessing specifications. Open interfaces and protocols defined by OpenGISÂ Specifications support interoperable solutions that \"geo-enable\" the Web, wireless and location-based services, and mainstreamÂ IT, and empower technology developers to make complex spatial information and services accessible and useful with all kinds of applications. Open Geospatial Consortium protocols include Web Map Service, and Web Feature Service.\n\nGISÂ products are broken down by theÂ OGC into two categories, based on how completely and accurately the software follows the OGCÂ specifications.\n\"Compliant Products\" are software products that comply to OGC'sÂ OpenGISÂ Specifications. When a product has been tested and certified as compliant through the OGCÂ Testing Program, the product is automatically registered as \"compliant\" on this site.\n\n\"Implementing Products\" are software products that implement OpenGISÂ Specifications but have not yet passed a compliance test. Compliance tests are not available for all specifications. Developers can register their products as implementing draft or approved specifications, though OGCÂ reserves the right to review and verify each entry.\n\nIn recent years there has been an proliferation of free-to-use and easily accessible mapping software such as the proprietary web applications GoogleÂ Maps and BingÂ Maps, as well as the free and open-source alternative OpenStreetMap. These services give the public access to huge amounts of geographic data.\n\nSome of them, like Google Maps and OpenLayers, expose an API that enable users to create custom applications. These toolkits commonly offer street maps, aerial/satellite imagery, geocoding, searches, and routing functionality. Web mapping has also uncovered the potential of crowdsourcing geodata in projects like OpenStreetMap, which is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world.\n\nThe condition of the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and subsurface can be examined by feeding satellite data into a GIS. GISÂ technology gives researchers the ability to examine the variations in Earth processes over days, months, and years. As an example, the changes in vegetation vigor through a growing season can be animated to determine when drought was most extensive in a particular region. The resulting graphic represents a rough measure of plant health. Working with two variables over time would then allow researchers to detect regional differences in the lag between a decline in rainfall and its effect on vegetation.\n\nGISÂ technology and the availability of digital data on regional and global scales enable such analyses. The satellite sensor output used to generate a vegetation graphic is produced for example by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). This sensor system detects the amounts of energy reflected from the Earth's surface across various bands of the spectrum for surface areas of about 1 square kilometer. The satellite sensor produces images of a particular location on the Earth twice a day. AVHRR and more recently the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are only two of many sensor systems used for Earth surface analysis. More sensors will follow, generating ever greater amounts of data.\n\nIn addition to the integration of time in environmental studies, GIS is also being explored for its ability to track and model the progress of humans throughout their daily routines. A concrete example of progress in this area is the recent release of time-specific population data by the U.S.Â Census. In this data set, the populations of cities are shown for daytime and evening hours highlighting the pattern of concentration and dispersion generated by North American commuting patterns. The manipulation and generation of data required to produce this data would not have been possible withoutÂ GIS.\n\nUsing models to project the data held by a GISÂ forward in time have enabled planners to test policy decisions using spatial decision support systems.\n\nTools and technologies emerging from the W3C's Data Activity are proving useful for data integration problems in information systems. Correspondingly, such technologies have been proposed as a means to facilitate interoperability and data reuse among GISÂ applications. and also to enable new analysis mechanisms.\n\nOntologies are a key component of this semantic approach as they allow a formal, machine-readable specification of the concepts and relationships in a given domain. This in turn allows a GIS to focus on the intended meaning of data rather than its syntax or structure. For example, reasoning that a land cover type classified as \"deciduous needleleaf trees\" in one dataset is a specialization or subset of land cover type \"forest\" in another more roughly classified dataset can help a GIS automatically merge the two datasets under the more general land cover classification. Tentative ontologies have been developed in areas related to GISÂ applications, for example the hydrology ontology developed by the Ordnance Survey in the United Kingdom and the SWEET ontologies developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Also, simpler ontologies and semantic metadata standards are being proposed by the W3C Geo Incubator Group to represent geospatial data on the web. GeoSPARQL is a standard developed by the Ordnance Survey, United States Geological Survey, Natural Resources Canada, Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and others to support ontology creation and reasoning using well-understood OGC literals (GML, WKT), topological relationships (Simple Features, RCC8, DE-9IM), RDF and the SPARQL database query protocols.\n\nRecent research results in this area can be seen in the International Conference on Geospatial Semantics and the Terra Cognita â Directions to the Geospatial Semantic Web workshop at the International Semantic Web Conference.\n\nWith the popularization of GIS in decision making, scholars have begun to scrutinize the social and political implications of GIS. GIS can also be misused to distort reality for individual and political gain. It has been argued that the production, distribution, utilization, and representation of geographic information are largely related with the social context and has the potential to increase citizen trust in government. Other related topics include discussion on copyright, privacy, and censorship. A more optimistic social approach to GISÂ adoption is to use it as a tool for public participation.\n\n", "id": "12398", "title": "Geographic information system"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12401", "text": "Graph theory\n\nIn mathematics graph theory is the study of \"graphs\", which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of \"vertices\", \"nodes\", or \"points\" which are connected by \"edges\", \"arcs\", or \"lines\". A graph may be \"undirected\", meaning that there is no distinction between the two vertices associated with each edge, or its edges may be \"directed\" from one vertex to another; see Graph (discrete mathematics) for more detailed definitions and for other variations in the types of graph that are commonly considered. Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics.\n\nRefer to the glossary of graph theory for basic definitions in graph theory.\n\nDefinitions in graph theory vary. The following are some of the more basic ways of defining graphs and related mathematical structures.\n\nIn the most common sense of the term, a graph is an ordered pair comprising a set \"V\" of \"vertices\" or \"nodes\" or \"points\" together with a set \"E\" of \"edges\" or \"arcs\" or \"lines\", which are 2-element subsets of \"V\" (i.e. an edge is associated with two vertices, and that association takes the form of the unordered pair comprising those two vertices). To avoid ambiguity, this type of graph may be described precisely as undirected and simple.\n\nOther senses of \"graph\" stem from different conceptions of the edge set. In one more generalized notion, \"V\" is a set together with a relation of \"incidence\" that associates with each edge two vertices. In another generalized notion, \"E\" is a multiset of unordered pairs of (not necessarily distinct) vertices. Many authors call this type of object a multigraph or pseudograph.\n\nAll of these variants and others are described more fully below.\n\nThe vertices belonging to an edge are called the \"ends\" or \"end vertices\" of the edge. A vertex may exist in a graph and not belong to an edge.\n\n\"V\" and \"E\" are usually taken to be finite, and many of the well-known results are not true (or are rather different) for infinite graphs because many of the arguments fail in the infinite case. The \"order\" of a graph is |\"V\"|, its number of vertices. The \"size\" of a graph is |\"E\"|, its number of edges. The \"degree\" or \"valency\" of a vertex is the number of edges that connect to it, where an edge that connects a vertex to itself (a loop) is counted twice.\n\nFor an edge }, graph theorists usually use the somewhat shorter notation \"xy\".\n\nGraphs can be used to model many types of relations and processes in physical, biological, social and information systems. Many practical problems can be represented by graphs. Emphasizing their application to real-world systems, the term \"network\" is sometimes defined to mean a graph in which attributes (e.g. names) are associated with the nodes and/or edges. \n\nIn computer science, graphs are used to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. For instance, the link structure of a website can be represented by a directed graph, in which the vertices represent web pages and directed edges represent links from one page to another. A similar approach can be taken to problems in social media, travel, biology, computer chip design, and many other fields. The development of algorithms to handle graphs is therefore of major interest in computer science. The transformation of graphs is often formalized and represented by graph rewrite systems. Complementary to graph transformation systems focusing on rule-based in-memory manipulation of graphs are graph databases geared towards transaction-safe, persistent storing and querying of graph-structured data.\n\nGraph-theoretic methods, in various forms, have proven particularly useful in linguistics, since natural language often lends itself well to discrete structure. Traditionally, syntax and compositional semantics follow tree-based structures, whose expressive power lies in the principle of compositionality, modeled in a hierarchical graph. More contemporary approaches such as head-driven phrase structure grammar model the syntax of natural language using typed feature structures, which are directed acyclic graphs. \nWithin lexical semantics, especially as applied to computers, modeling word meaning is easier when a given word is understood in terms of related words; semantic networks are therefore important in computational linguistics. Still other methods in phonology (e.g. optimality theory, which uses lattice graphs) and morphology (e.g. finite-state morphology, using finite-state transducers) are common in the analysis of language as a graph. Indeed, the usefulness of this area of mathematics to linguistics has borne organizations such as TextGraphs, as well as various 'Net' projects, such as WordNet, VerbNet, and others.\n\nGraph theory is also used to study molecules in chemistry and physics. In condensed matter physics, the three-dimensional structure of complicated simulated atomic structures can be studied quantitatively by gathering statistics on graph-theoretic properties related to the topology of the atoms. In chemistry a graph makes a natural model for a molecule, where vertices represent atoms and edges bonds. This approach is especially used in computer processing of molecular structures, ranging from chemical editors to database searching. In statistical physics, graphs can represent local connections between interacting parts of a system, as well as the dynamics of a physical process on such\nsystems. Similarly, in computational neuroscience graphs can be used to represent functional connections between brain areas that interact to give rise to various cognitive processes, where the vertices represent different areas of the brain and the edges represent the connections between those areas. Graphs are also used to represent the micro-scale channels of porous media, in which the vertices represent the pores and the edges represent the smaller channels connecting the pores.\n\nGraph theory is also widely used in sociology as a way, for example, to measure actors' prestige or to explore rumor spreading, notably through the use of social network analysis software. Under the umbrella of social networks are many different types of graphs. Acquaintanceship and friendship graphs describe whether people know each other. Influence graphs model whether certain people can influence the behavior of others. Finally, collaboration graphs model whether two people work together in a particular way, such as acting in a movie together.\n\nLikewise, graph theory is useful in biology and conservation efforts where a vertex can represent regions where certain species exist (or inhabit) and the edges represent migration paths, or movement between the regions. This information is important when looking at breeding patterns or tracking the spread of disease, parasites or how changes to the movement can affect other species.\n\nIn mathematics, graphs are useful in geometry and certain parts of topology such as knot theory. Algebraic graph theory has close links with group theory.\n\nA graph structure can be extended by assigning a weight to each edge of the graph. Graphs with weights, or weighted graphs, are used to represent structures in which pairwise connections have some numerical values. For example, if a graph represents a road network, the weights could represent the length of each road.\n\nThe paper written by Leonhard Euler on the \"Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg\" and published in 1736 is regarded as the first paper in the history of graph theory. This paper, as well as the one written by Vandermonde on the \"knight problem,\" carried on with the \"analysis situs\" initiated by Leibniz. Euler's formula relating the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a convex polyhedron was studied and generalized by Cauchy and L'Huillier, and represents the beginning of the branch of mathematics known as topology.\n\nMore than one century after Euler's paper on the bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg and while Listing was introducing the concept of topology, Cayley was led by an interest in particular analytical forms arising from differential calculus to study a particular class of graphs, the \"trees\". This study had many implications for theoretical chemistry. The techniques he used mainly concern the enumeration of graphs with particular properties. Enumerative graph theory then arose from the results of Cayley and the fundamental results published by PÃ³lya between 1935 and 1937. These were generalized by De Bruijn in 1959. Cayley linked his results on trees with contemporary studies of chemical composition. The fusion of ideas from mathematics with those from chemistry began what has become part of the standard terminology of graph theory.\n\nIn particular, the term \"graph\" was introduced by Sylvester in a paper published in 1878 in \"Nature\", where he draws an analogy between \"quantic invariants\" and \"co-variants\" of algebra and molecular diagrams:\n\nThe first textbook on graph theory was written by DÃ©nes KÅnig, and published in 1936. Another book by Frank Harary, published in 1969, was \"considered the world over to be the definitive textbook on the subject\", and enabled mathematicians, chemists, electrical engineers and social scientists to talk to each other. Harary donated all of the royalties to fund the PÃ³lya Prize.\n\nOne of the most famous and stimulating problems in graph theory is the four color problem: \"Is it true that any map drawn in the plane may have its regions colored with four colors, in such a way that any two regions having a common border have different colors?\" This problem was first posed by Francis Guthrie in 1852 and its first written record is in a letter of De Morgan addressed to Hamilton the same year. Many incorrect proofs have been proposed, including those by Cayley, Kempe, and others. The study and the generalization of this problem by Tait, Heawood, Ramsey and Hadwiger led to the study of the colorings of the graphs embedded on surfaces with arbitrary genus. Tait's reformulation generated a new class of problems, the \"factorization problems\", particularly studied by Petersen and KÅnig. The works of Ramsey on colorations and more specially the results obtained by TurÃ¡n in 1941 was at the origin of another branch of graph theory, \"extremal graph theory\".\n\nThe four color problem remained unsolved for more than a century. In 1969 Heinrich Heesch published a method for solving the problem using computers. A computer-aided proof produced in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken makes fundamental use of the notion of \"discharging\" developed by Heesch. The proof involved checking the properties of 1,936 configurations by computer, and was not fully accepted at the time due to its complexity. A simpler proof considering only 633 configurations was given twenty years later by Robertson, Seymour, Sanders and Thomas.\n\nThe autonomous development of topology from 1860 and 1930 fertilized graph theory back through the works of Jordan, Kuratowski and Whitney. Another important factor of common development of graph theory and topology came from the use of the techniques of modern algebra. The first example of such a use comes from the work of the physicist Gustav Kirchhoff, who published in 1845 his Kirchhoff's circuit laws for calculating the voltage and current in electric circuits.\n\nThe introduction of probabilistic methods in graph theory, especially in the study of ErdÅs and RÃ©nyi of the asymptotic probability of graph connectivity, gave rise to yet another branch, known as \"random graph theory\", which has been a fruitful source of graph-theoretic results.\n\nGraphs are represented visually by drawing a dot or circle for every vertex, and drawing an arc between two vertices if they are connected by an edge. If the graph is directed, the direction is indicated by drawing an arrow.\n\nA graph drawing should not be confused with the graph itself (the abstract, non-visual structure) as there are several ways to structure the graph drawing. All that matters is which vertices are connected to which others by how many edges and not the exact layout. In practice it is often difficult to decide if two drawings represent the same graph. Depending on the problem domain some layouts may be better suited and easier to understand than others.\n\nThe pioneering work of W. T. Tutte was very influential in the subject of graph drawing. Among other achievements, he introduced the use of linear algebraic methods to obtain graph drawings.\n\nGraph drawing also can be said to encompass problems that deal with the crossing number and its various generalizations. The crossing number of a graph is the minimum number of intersections between edges that a drawing of the graph in the plane must contain. For a planar graph, the crossing number is zero by definition.\n\nDrawings on surfaces other than the plane are also studied.\n\nThere are different ways to store graphs in a computer system. The data structure used depends on both the graph structure and the algorithm used for manipulating the graph. Theoretically one can distinguish between list and matrix structures but in concrete applications the best structure is often a combination of both. List structures are often preferred for sparse graphs as they have smaller memory requirements. Matrix structures on the other hand provide faster access for some applications but can consume huge amounts of memory.\n\nList structures include the incidence list, an array of pairs of vertices, and the adjacency list, which separately lists the neighbors of each vertex: Much like the incidence list, each vertex has a list of which vertices it is adjacent to.\n\nMatrix structures include the incidence matrix, a matrix of 0's and 1's whose rows represent vertices and whose columns represent edges, and the adjacency matrix, in which both the rows and columns are indexed by vertices. In both cases a 1 indicates two adjacent objects and a 0 indicates two non-adjacent objects. The Laplacian matrix is a modified form of the adjacency matrix that incorporates information about the degrees of the vertices, and is useful in some calculations such as Kirchhoff's theorem on the number of spanning trees of a graph.\nThe distance matrix, like the adjacency matrix, has both its rows and columns indexed by vertices, but rather than containing a 0 or a 1 in each cell it contains the length of a shortest path between two vertices.\n\nThere is a large literature on graphical enumeration: the problem of counting graphs meeting specified conditions. Some of this work is found in Harary and Palmer (1973).\n\nA common problem, called the subgraph isomorphism problem, is finding a fixed graph as a subgraph in a given graph. One reason to be interested in such a question is that many graph properties are \"hereditary\" for subgraphs, which means that a graph has the property if and only if all subgraphs have it too.\nUnfortunately, finding maximal subgraphs of a certain kind is often an NP-complete problem. For example:\n\nA similar problem is finding induced subgraphs in a given graph. Again, some important graph properties are hereditary with respect to induced subgraphs, which means that a graph has a property if and only if all induced subgraphs also have it. Finding maximal induced subgraphs of a certain kind is also often NP-complete. For example:\n\nStill another such problem, the minor containment problem, is to find a fixed graph as a minor of a given graph. A minor or subcontraction of a graph is any graph obtained by taking a subgraph and contracting some (or no) edges. Many graph properties are hereditary for minors, which means that a graph has a property if and only if all minors have it too. For example, Wagner's Theorem states: \n\nA similar problem, the subdivision containment problem, is to find a fixed graph as a subdivision of a given graph. A subdivision or homeomorphism of a graph is any graph obtained by subdividing some (or no) edges. Subdivision containment is related to graph properties such as planarity. For example, Kuratowski's Theorem states: \n\nAnother problem in subdivision containment is Kelmans-Seymour conjecture:\nAnother class of problems has to do with the extent to which various species and generalizations of graphs are determined by their \"point-deleted subgraphs\".

In these applications, graphs are ordered by specificity, meaning that more constrained graphsâwhich are more specific and thus contain a greater amount of informationâare subsumed by those that are more general. Operations between graphs include evaluating the direction of a subsumption relationship between two graphs, if any, and computing graph unification. The unification of two argument graphs is defined as the most general graph (or the computation thereof) that is consistent with (i.e. contains all of the information in) the inputs, if such a graph exists; efficient unification algorithms are known.\n\nFor constraint frameworks which are strictly compositional, graph unification is the sufficient satisfiability and combination function.

The character has been the subject of two television series as well as a feature-length film and other media. Since the original series' run, he has become well known as an example of stop motion clay animation and an influential cultural icon, spawning many tributes, parodies, and merchandising.\n\n\"Gumby\" follows the titular character and his adventures through different environments and times in history. Gumby's principal sidekick is Pokey, a talking orange pony. His nemeses are the Blockheads, a pair of humanoid, red-colored figures with cube-shaped heads, who wreak mischief and havoc. The Blockheads were inspired by The Katzenjammer Kids, who were always getting into scrapes and causing discomfort to others. Other characters are Prickle, a yellow dinosaur who sometimes styles himself as a detective with pipe and deerstalker hat like Sherlock Holmes, and Goo, a flying blue mermaid who spits blue goo balls and can change shape at will. Also featured are Gumby's dog Nopey, whose entire vocabulary is the word \"nope,\" and Gumby's parents, Gumbo and Gumba. The later syndicated series in 1988 added Gumby's sister Minga and mastodon friend Denali.\n\nGumby was created by Art Clokey in the early 1950s after he finished film school at the University of Southern California. Clokey's first animated film was a 1953 three-minute student film called \"Gumbasia\", a surreal montage of moving and expanding lumps of clay set to music in a parody of Disney's \"Fantasia\". \"Gumbasia\" was created in a style that Clokey's professor Slavko VorkapiÄ taught at USC called Kinesthetic Film Principles, described as \"massaging of the eye cells.\" This technique of camera movements and editing was responsible for much of the Gumby look and feel. In 1955, Clokey showed \"Gumbasia\" to movie producer Sam Engel, who encouraged him to develop his technique by animating figures into children's stories.\n\nClokey moved forward, producing a pilot featuring the character Gumby, which derived its name from the muddy clay found at Clokey's grandparents' farm that his family referred to as \"gumbo\". The look of Gumby was inspired by a suggestion from his wife Ruth (nÃ©e Parkander) that Clokey base his character on The Gingerbread Man. The color green was then chosen because Clokey saw it as a racially neutral color, as well as being a symbol of life. Gumby's legs and feet were made wide for pragmatic reasons: they ensured that the clay character would stand up during stop-motion filming. The famous slanted shape of Gumby's head was based on the hair style of Clokey's father Charles Farrington in an old photograph.\n\nNBC executive Thomas Warren Sarnoff saw and loved Clokey's first pilot and had Clokey make another one (\"Gumby on the Moon\"). This became a huge hit on \"Howdy Doody\", leading Sarnoff to order Gumby his own series in 1955 entitled \"The Gumby Show\". In 1955 and 1956, 22 eleven-minute episodes aired on NBC. Gumby's voice was originally provided by Ruth Eggleston, wife of the show's art director Al Eggleston, until Dallas McKennon became the primary voice of Gumby in 1957. Because of its variety-type format, the show featured Clokey's puppet films plus interviews and games, as well. During this time, the show went through a succession of two hosts: Robert Nicholson and Pinky Lee.\n\nIn 1959, the show entered syndication and more episodes were later produced in the 1960s. Production continued through 1968, by which time Norma MacMillan voiced Gumby. On some occasions during this time, Gumby's voice was provided by Ginny Tyler and Dick Beals.\n\nBeginning in 1982, Eddie Murphy began a parody of Gumby on \"Saturday Night Live\". According to Murphyâs parody, when the television cameras were turned off, the sweet Gumby reverted to his true self: a cigar chomping, irascible celebrity who was highly demanding of the production executives. Whenever the executives refused to give in to his demands, Gumby would assert his star status by saying âIâm \"Gumby\", dammit!â\n\nIn 1987, the original Gumby shorts enjoyed a revival on home video. The following year, the character appeared in \"The Puppetoon Movie\".\n\nThis renewed interest led to a new incarnation of the series consisting of ninety-nine brand new 7-minute episodes produced for television syndication in association with Lorimar-Telepictures in 1987. Dallas McKennon returned as the voice of Gumby in the new adventures that would take Gumby and his pals beyond their toyland-type setting and establish themselves as a sing-a-long band. The show also included new characters, such as Gumby's little sister Minga and a mastodon named Denali.\n\nIn addition to the new episodes, the classic 1950s and 1960s shorts were re-run as part of the series, but with newly recorded soundtracks, with the voices re-recorded and the original music replaced by Jerry Gerber's synthesizer score from the 1988 series. Clokey's rights to use the original Capitol Records production tracks could not be renewed at the time, due to legal issues.\n\nIn 1995, Clokey's production company produced an independently released theatrical film, \"\" (a.k.a. \"Gumby 1\"), marking the clay character's first feature-length adventure. In it, the villainous Blockheads replace Gumby and his band with robots and kidnap their dog, Lowbelly. The movie featured in-joke homages to such sci-fi classics as \"Star Wars\", \"The Terminator\", and \"\". Starting in 1992, TV channels like Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network aired re-runs of \"Gumby\" episodes. In 1998, the \"Gumby\" episode \"Robot Rumpus\" was featured on \"Mystery Science Theatre 3000\".\n\nOn March 16, 2007, YouTube announced that all Gumby episodes would appear in their full-length form on its site, digitally remastered and with their original soundtracks. This deal also extended to other video sites, including AOL. In March 2007, KQED-TV broadcast an hour-long documentary \"Gumby Dharma\" as part of their \"Truly CA\" series.\n\nIn 2012, Me-TV began airing \"Gumby\" as a part of a weekend morning animation block. The show remained part of the channel's programming until the end of the year.\n\nOn April 8, 2015, it was announced that there is a new \"Gumby\" series in the works which will be co-produced by the Jim Henson Company, but as of August 2016 there has been no new information.\n\n\nIn 1993, \"TV Guide\" named \"Gumby\" the best cartoon series of the 1950s in its issue celebrating 40 years of television.\n\nBeginning in 1994, the Library of Congress used Gumby as a spokescharacter due to a common sequence in the show where Gumby walks into a book and experiences the world within the book as a tangible place. This then led to a traveling exhibit called \"Adventures into Books: Gumby's World\", a promotion for the Center for the Book's national reading campaign from 1997 to 2000. By the end of the 90s, Gumby and Pokey had also appeared in commercials for Cheerios cereal, most notably Frosted Cheerios.\n\nOn August 4, 2006, the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta opened \"Art Clokey's Gumby: The First Fifty Years\", an exhibition featuring many of the original Puppets and sets; along with screening the films of Art Clokey. The event, conceived by David Scheve of T.D.A. Animation and Joe Clokey of Premavision was one of several exhibits that opened around the country, celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of \"The Gumby Show\". The children's book \"Gumby Goes to the Sun\" was also published that year to coincide with the anniversary. Written and illustrated by Clokey's daughter, Holly Harman, the book was originally created in the 1980s.\n\nIn 2007, the \"Gumby\" comic book series was nominated for two Eisner Awards, winning one of them, Best Publication For a Younger Audience.\n\nOn October 12, 2011, Google paid tribute to Art Clokeyâs 90th birthday featuring clay balls transforming into characters from Gumby. The doodle was composed of five clay balls in the Google colors placed beside a toy block with a \"G\" on it. Clicking any of the balls revealed the Blockheads, Prickle, Goo, Gumby, and Pokey.\n\nIn a 2014 episode of the Disney XD series \"Gravity Falls\" called \"Little Gift Shop of Horrors\", the character of Soos Ramierez appears in the \"Clay Day\" segment of that episode as a character that looks very much like Gumby.\n\nVarious Gumby merchandise has been produced over the years, the most prominent item being bendable figures. Several single packs and multi-figure sets by Jesco (later Trendmasters), as well as a 50th anniversary collection, have been made of the Gumby characters. Also included in the Gumby merchandise catalog are plush dolls, keychains, mugs, a 1988 Colorforms set, a 1995 Trendmasters playset, and a Kubricks set by Medicom. A tribute album, \"Gumby: The Green Album\", produced by Shepard Stern was released in 1989 through Buena Vista Records.\n\nIn August 2005, the first video game featuring Gumby, \"Gumby vs. the Astrobots\", was released by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. In it, Gumby must rescue Pokey, Prickle, and Goo after they are captured by the Blockheads and their cohorts, the Astrobots.\n\nThe Gumby images and toys are registered trademarks of Prema Toy Company. Premavision owns the distribution rights to the \"Gumby\" cartoons, having been reverted from previous distributor Warner Bros. Television in 2003, and had licensed the rights to Classic Media until September 30, 2012. At this time, Classic Media was officially acquired by DreamWorks Animation and branded as DreamWorks Classics, which became a subsidiary of NBCUniversal in 2016.\n\nAs of April 2015, NCircle Entertainment owns home video and digital distribution rights to the cartoons.\n\n\n", "id": "12405", "title": "Gumby"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12406", "text": "Gioachino Rossini\n\nGioachino Antonio Rossini (; 29 February 179213Â November 1868) was an Italian composer who wrote operas, as well as some sacred music, songs, chamber music and piano pieces.\n\nA precocious composer of operas, he made his full debut at the age of eighteen (with \"La cambiale di matrimonio\"). His best-known operas include the Italian comedies \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" (\"The Barber of Seville\"), \"L'italiana in Algeri\" (\"The Italian Girl in Algiers\") and \"La Cenerentola\" (\"Cinderella\"). He also wrote a string of serious operas in Italian, including works such as \"Tancredi\", \"Otello\" and \"Semiramide\". The semi-serious opera \"La Gazza Ladra\" (\"The Thieving Magpie\") has one of Rossini's most celebrated overtures. After moving to Paris in 1824, he eventually started to write in French. His last opera, the epic \"Guillaume Tell\" (\"William Tell\"), replete with its iconic overture, helped usher in grand opera in France. \n\nAfter composing thirty-nine significant operas in nineteen years Rossini retired from the theatre in 1829. Later, he was affected by both physical and mental illnesses and for decades wrote relatively little apart from a setting of the \"Stabat Mater\". A return to Paris from Italy in 1855 was followed by better health and the provision of exclusive musical and culinary soirÃ©es. During these, he presented salon music in the form of songs, piano pieces and small chamber ensembles that he called \"Sins of Old Age\". He considered the last of these \"Sins\" to be the unusually scored \"Petite messe solennelle\" (Little solemn mass) that he wrote in 1863, the year before his death.\n\nRossini had been the most popular opera composer in history, and he was one of the most renowned public figures of his time. A rapid and prolific composer, he was quoted as joking, \"Give me the laundress' bill and I will even set that to music.\" A tendency for inspired, song-like melodies is evident throughout his scores, earning him the nickname \"The Italian Mozart.\" Use of an exciting build up of orchestral sound over a repeated phraseâcommonly known as a \"Rossini crescendo\"âalso prompted the nickname \"Signor Crescendo\".\n\nGioachino Antonio Rossini was born into a family of musicians in Pesaro, a town on the Adriatic coast of Italy that was then part of the Papal States. His father, Giuseppe, was a horn player and inspector of slaughterhouses. His mother, Anna, was a singer and a baker's daughter. Rossini's parents began his musical training early, and by the age of six he was playing the triangle in his father's musical group.\n\nRossini's father was sympathetic to the French Revolution and welcomed Napoleon's troops when they arrived in northern Italy. When Austria restored the old regime, Rossini's father was sent to prison in 1799, where he remained until June 1800. Rossini's mother took him to Bologna, making a living as leading singer at various theatres of the Romagna region. Her husband would ultimately join her in Bologna. During this time, Rossini was frequently left in the care of his aging grandmother, who had difficulty supervising the boy.\n\nHe remained at Bologna in the care of a pork butcher while his father played the horn in the orchestras of the theatres at which his wife sang. The boy had three years of instruction in the playing of the harpsichord from Giuseppe Prinetti, originally from Novara, who played the scale with two fingers only; Prinetti also owned a business selling beer and had a propensity to fall asleep while standing. These qualities made him a subject for ridicule in the eyes of the young Rossini.\n\nHe was eventually taken from Prinetti and apprenticed to a blacksmith. In Angelo Tesei, he found a congenial music master, and learned to sight-read, play accompaniments on the piano and sing well enough to take solo parts in the church when he was ten years of age. Important products of this period are six \"sonate a quattro\", or string sonatas, composed in three days, unusually scored for two violins, cello and double bass. The original scores, dating from 1804 when the composer was twelve, were found in the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. Often transcribed for string orchestra, these sonatas reveal the young composer's affinity for Haydn and Mozart, already showing signs of operatic tendencies, punctuated by frequent rhythmic changes and dominated by clear, songlike melodies.\n\nIn 1805, he appeared at the theatre of the Commune in Ferdinando Paer's \"Camilla\", his only public appearance as a singer. He was also a capable horn player, treading in the footsteps of his father. Around this time, he composed individual numbers to a libretto by Vincenza Mombelli called \"Demetrio e Polibio\", which was handed to the boy in pieces. Though it was Rossini's first opera, written when he was thirteen or fourteen, the work was not staged until the composer was twenty years old, premiering as his sixth official opera.\n\nIn 1806, Rossini became a cello student under Cavedagni at the Conservatorio di Bologna. The following year he was admitted to the counterpoint class of Padre Stanislao Mattei (1750â1825). He learned to play the cello with ease, but the pedantic severity of Mattei's views on counterpoint served only to drive the young composer's views toward a freer school of composition. His insight into orchestral resources is generally ascribed not to the strict compositional rules that he learned from Mattei, but to knowledge gained independently while scoring the quartets and symphonies of Haydn and Mozart. At Bologna, he was known as \"il Tedeschino\" (\"the Little German\") on account of his devotion to Mozart.\n\nThrough the friendly interposition of the Marquis Cavalli, his first opera, \"La cambiale di matrimonio\" (\"The Marriage Contract\"), was produced at Venice when he was a youth of 18 years. Two years before this he had already received the prize at the Conservatorio of Bologna for his cantata \"Il pianto d'Armonia sulla morte d'Orfeo\". Between 1810 and 1813 at Bologna, Rome, Venice and Milan, Rossini produced operas of varying success, most notably \"La pietra del paragone\" and \"Il signor Bruschino\", with its brilliant and unique overture. In 1813, \"Tancredi\" and \"L'italiana in Algeri\" were even bigger successes, and catapulted the 20-year-old composer to international fame.\n\nThe libretto for \"Tancredi\" was an arrangement by Gaetano Rossi of Voltaire's tragedy \"TancrÃ¨de\". Traces of Ferdinando Paer and Giovanni Paisiello were undeniably present in fragments of the music. But any critical feeling on the part of the public was drowned by appreciation of such melodies as \"\"Di tanti palpiti... Mi rivedrai, ti rivedrÃ²\"\", which became so popular that the Italians would sing it in crowds at the law courts until called upon by the judge to desist.\nBy the age of 21, Rossini had established himself as the idol of the Italian opera public. He continued to write operas for Venice and Milan during the next few years, but their reception was tame and in some cases unsatisfactory after the success of \"Tancredi.\" In 1815 he retired to his home in Bologna, where Domenico Barbaia, the impresario of the Naples theatre, contracted an agreement that made him musical director of the Teatro di San Carlo and the Teatro del Fondo at Naples. He would compose one opera a year for each. His payment was to be 200 ducats per month; he was also to receive a share from the gambling tables set in the theatre's \"ridotto\", amounting to about 1000 ducats per annum. This was an extraordinarily lucrative arrangement for any professional musician at that time.\n\nHe visited the Naples conservatory, and, although less than four years senior to Mercadante, he said to the Director NiccolÃ² Zingarelli, \"My compliments Maestro â your young pupil Mercadante begins where we finish.\"\n\nSome older composers in Naples, notably Zingarelli and Paisiello, were inclined to intrigue against the success of the youthful composer, but all hostility was rendered futile by the enthusiasm that greeted the court performance of his \"Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra\", in which Isabella Colbran, who subsequently became the composer's wife, took a leading part. The libretto of this opera by Giovanni Schmidt was in many of its incidents an anticipation of those presented to the world a few years later in Sir Walter Scott's \"Kenilworth\". The opera was the first in which Rossini wrote out the ornaments of the arias instead of leaving them to the fancy of the singers, and also the first in which the recitativo \"secco\" was replaced by a recitative accompanied by a string quartet.\n\nRossini's most famous opera was produced on 20 February 1816, at the Teatro Argentina in Rome. The libretto, a version of Pierre Beaumarchais' stage play \"Le Barbier de SÃ©ville\", was newly written by Cesare Sterbini and not the same as that already used by Giovanni Paisiello in his own \"Barbiere\", an opera which had enjoyed European popularity for more than a quarter of a century. Much is made of how quickly Rossini's opera was written, scholarship generally agreeing upon two or three weeks. Later in life, Rossini claimed to have written the opera in only twelve days. It was a colossal failure when it premiered as \"Almaviva\"; Paisiello's admirers were extremely indignant, sabotaging the production by whistling and shouting during the entire first act. However, not long after the second performance, the opera became so successful that the fame of Paisiello's opera was transferred to Rossini's, to which the title \"The Barber of Seville\" passed as an inalienable heritage.\n\nLater in 1822, a 30-year-old Rossini succeeded in meeting Ludwig van Beethoven, who was then aged 51, deaf, cantankerous and in failing health. Communicating in writing, Beethoven noted: \"Ah, Rossini. So you're the composer of \"The Barber of Seville\". I congratulate you. It will be played as long as Italian opera exists. Never try to write anything else but opera buffa; any other style would do violence to your nature.\"\n\nBetween 1815 and 1823 Rossini produced 20 operas. Of these, \"Otello\" formed the climax to his reform of serious opera (\"opera seria\"), and offers a suggestive contrast with the treatment of the same subject at a similar point of artistic development by the composer Giuseppe Verdi. In Rossini's time, the tragic ending was so distasteful to the public of Rome that it was necessary to invent a happy conclusion to \"Otello\".\n\nConditions of stage production in 1817 are illustrated by Rossini's acceptance of the subject of Cinderella for a libretto only on the condition that the supernatural element should be omitted. The opera \"La Cenerentola\" was as successful as \"Barbiere\". The absence of a similar precaution in construction of his \"MosÃ¨ in Egitto\" led to disaster in the scene depicting the passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea, when the defects in stage contrivance always raised a laugh, so that the composer was at length compelled to introduce the chorus \"Dal tuo stellato soglio\" to divert attention from the dividing waves.\n\nIn 1822, four years after the production of this work, Rossini married the renowned opera singer Isabella Colbran. In the same year, he moved from Italy to Vienna, where his operas were the rage of the audiences. He directed his \"Cenerentola\" in Vienna, where \"Zelmira\" was also performed. After this he returned to Bologna, but an invitation from Metternich to the Congress of Verona to \"assist in the general re-establishment of harmony\" was too tempting to refuse, and he arrived at the Congress in time for its opening on 20 October 1822. Here he made friends with Chateaubriand and Dorothea Lieven. The opera Semiramide was first performed at La Fenice in Venice on 3 February 1823. It was Rossini's last Italian opera.\n\nIn 1823, at the suggestion of the manager of the King's Theatre, London, he came to Britain, being much fÃªted on his way through Paris. He was given a generous welcome, which included an introduction to King George IV and the receipt of Â£7000 (Â£ today) after a residence of five months. The next year, he became musical director of the ThÃ©Ã¢tre des Italiens in Paris at a salary of Â£800 (Â£ today) per annum. Rossini's popularity in Paris was so great that Charles X gave him a contract to write five new operas a year, and at the expiration of the contract, he was to receive a generous pension for life.\n\nDuring his Paris years, Rossini created the comic operas \"Le comte Ory\" and \"Guillaume Tell\" (\"William Tell\"). The production of the latter in 1829 brought his career as a writer of opera to a close. He was thirty-eight years old and had already composed thirty-eight operas. \"Guillaume Tell\" was a political epic adapted from Schiller's play \"Wilhelm Tell\" (1804) about the 13th-century Swiss patriot who rallied his country against the Austrians. The libretto was by Ãtienne Jouy and Hippolyte Bis, but their version was revised by Armand Marrast.\n\nThe music is remarkable for its freedom from the conventions discovered and utilized by Rossini in his earlier works, and marks a transitional stage in the history of opera, the overture serving as a model for romantic overtures throughout the 19th century. Though an excellent opera, it is rarely heard uncut today, as the original score runs more than four hours in performance. The overture is one of the most famous and frequently recorded works in the classical repertoire.\n\nIn 1829 he returned to Bologna. His mother had died in 1827, and he was anxious to be with his father. Arrangements for his subsequent return to Paris on a new agreement were temporarily upset by the abdication of Charles X and the July Revolution of 1830. Rossini, who had been considering the subject of Faust for a new opera, did return, however, to Paris in November of that year.\n\nSix movements of his \"Stabat Mater\" were written in 1832 by Rossini himself and the other six by Giovanni Tadolini, a good musician who was asked by Rossini to complete the work. However, Rossini composed the rest of the score in 1841. The success of the work bears comparison with his achievements in opera, but his comparative silence during the period from 1832 to his death in 1868 makes his biography appear almost like the narrative of two livesâthe life of swift triumph and the long life of seclusion, of which biographers give us pictures in stories of the composer's cynical wit, his speculations in fish mongering, his mask of humility and indifference.\n\nHis first wife died in 1845, and on 16 August 1846, he married Olympe PÃ©lissier, who had sat for Vernet for his picture of \"Judith and Holofernes\". Political disturbances compelled Rossini to leave Bologna in 1848. After living for a time in Florence, he settled in Paris in 1855, where he hosted many artistic and literary figures in his apartment at 2 Rue de la ChaussÃ©e-d'Antin, among whom the forty years younger Belgian mattauphone virtuoso Edmond Michotte, considering him as his \"quasi figlio\".\n\nRossini had been a well-known gourmand and an excellent amateur chef his entire life, but he indulged these two passions fully once he retired from composing, and today there are a number of dishes with the appendage \"alla Rossini\" to their names that were created either by or specifically for him. Probably the most famous of these is tournedos Rossini, still served by many restaurants today.\n\nIn the meantime, after years of various physical and mental illnesses, he had slowly returned to music, composing obscure little works intended for private performance. These included his PÃ©chÃ©s de vieillesse (\"Sins of Old Age\"), which are grouped into 14 volumes, mostly for solo piano, occasionally for voice and various chamber ensembles. Often whimsical, these pieces display Rossini's natural ease of composition and gift for melody, showing obvious influences of Beethoven and Chopin, with many flashes of the composer's long buried desire for serious, academic composition. They also underpin the fact that Rossini himself was an outstanding pianist whose playing attracted high praise from people such as Franz Liszt, Sigismond Thalberg, Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns and Louis DiÃ©mer.\n\nHe died at the age of 76 from pneumonia at his country house at Passy on Friday, 13 November 1868. He was buried in PÃ¨re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France. In 1887, his remains were moved to the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence, at the request of the Italian government.\n\nAccording to Herbert Weinstock's 1968 biography, the composer's estate was valued at 2.5 million francs upon his death in 1868, the equivalent of about 1.4 million US dollars. According to one contemporary account, at the time of Rossini's death, his estate yielded revenues of 150,000 francs per year. Apart from some individual legacies in favour of his wife and relatives, Rossini willed his entire estate to the Comune of Pesaro. The inheritance was invested to establish a (Conservatory) in the town. In 1940, the was put under state control and turned into the Conservatorio Statale di Musica \"Gioachino Rossini\". The corporate body which managed Rossini's inheritance assumed the name Fondazione G. Rossini. The aims of the institution, which is still active, are to support the conservatory and promote the figure, the memory, and the works of Rossini. The institution has been a major sponsor of the Rossini Opera Festival since its beginning.\n\nRossini's estate funded the Prix Rossini, a prize awarded to young French composers and librettists. The prize began to be awarded in 1878 on the death of his widow and is given by the AcadÃ©mie des Beaux-Arts. Prize-winning works were produced by the SociÃ©tÃ© des Concerts, Institut de France, from 1885 to 1911. The bequest sought to reward composers of music which emphasized melody, which Rossini wrote \"today is neglected\" (\"\"). The prize for librettists was to be given to writers who observed \"the laws of morality, which the modern writers completely ignore\" (\"\"). The prizes were exclusively for French composers and librettists (\"\").\n\nRossini was a foreign associate of the institute, Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour and recipient of innumerable orders.\n\nImmediately after Rossini's death, Giuseppe Verdi proposed to collaborate with twelve other Italian composers on a \"Requiem for Rossini\", to be performed on the first anniversary of Rossini's death, conducted by Angelo Mariani. The music was written, but the performance was abandoned shortly before its scheduled premiere. Verdi re-used the \"Libera me, Domine\" he had written for the Rossini Requiem in his 1872 \"Requiem for Manzoni\". In 1989 the conductor Helmuth Rilling recorded the original \"Requiem for Rossini\" in its world premiere.\n\nIn 1900, Giuseppe Cassioli created a monument to Rossini in the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence.\n\nThe Library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels possesses an important collection of scores, documents and objects from Rossini, assembled in the Edmond Michotte fund.\n\nMauro Giuliani (who died in 1829) wrote six sets of variations for guitar on themes by Rossini, Opp. 119â124 (c. 1820â1828). Each set was called \"Rossiniana\", and collectively they are called \"Rossiniane\". This was the first known tribute by one composer to another using a title with the ending -ana.\n\nIn 1925, Ottorino Respighi orchestrated four pieces from \"PÃ©chÃ©s de vieillesse\" as the suite \"Rossiniana\" (he had earlier used pieces from the same collection as the basis of his ballet \"La Boutique fantasque\").\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford History of Western Music\", \"Rossini's fame surpassed that of any previous composer, and so, for a long time, did the popularity of his works. Audiences took to his music as if to an intoxicating drug â or, to put it more decorously, to champagne, with which Rossini's bubbly music was constantly compared.\"\n\nRossini took existing operatic genres and forms and perfected them in his own style. Through his own work, as well as through that of his followers and imitators, Rossini's style dominated Italian opera throughout the first half of the 19th century.\n\nIn his compositions, Rossini plagiarized freely from himself, a common practice among deadline-pressed opera composers of the time. Few of his operas are without such admixtures, frankly introduced in the form of arias or overtures. For example, in \"Il Barbiere\" there is an aria for the Count (often omitted) \"Cessa di piÃ¹ resistere\", which Rossini used (with minor changes) in the cantata \"Le Nozze di Teti e di Peleo\" and in \"La Cenerentola\" (the cabaletta for Angelina's rondo is almost unchanged). Moreover, four of his best known overtures (\"La cambiale di matrimonio\", \"Tancredi\", \"La Cenerentola\" and \"The Barber of Seville\") share operas apart from those with which they are most famously associated.\n\nA characteristic mannerism in Rossini's orchestral scoring is a long, steady building of sound over an ostinato figure, known as a \"Rossini crescendo\", creating \"tempests in teapots by beginning in a whisper and rising to a flashing, glittering storm,\" which earned him the nickname of \"Signor Crescendo\".\n\nA few of Rossini's operas remained popular throughout his lifetime and continuously since his death; others were resurrected from semi-obscurity in the last half of the 20th century, during the so-called \"Rossini Renaissance\".\n\nRossini himself correctly predicted that his \"Barber of Seville\" would continue to find favor with posterity, telling a friend:\n\n\n\n\nTexts, books\n\nSheet music\n\nPerformances\n", "id": "12406", "title": "Gioachino Rossini"}

It may include speech sounds that are not actual words, or forms such as language games or highly specialized jargon that seems non-sensical to outsiders. Gibberish should not be confused with literary nonsense such as that used in the poem \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll.\n\nThe word \"gibberish\" is more commonly applied to informal speech, while \"gobbledygook\" (sometimes \"gobbledegook\", \"gobbledigook\" or \"gobbledegoo\") is more often applied to writing or language that is meaningless or is made unintelligible by excessive use of abstruse technical terms. \"Officialese\", \"legalese\", or \"bureaucratese\" are forms of gobbledygook. The related word \"jibber-jabber\" refers to rapid talk that is difficult to understand.\n\nThe term \"gibberish\" was first seen in English in the early 16th century. Its etymology is not certain, but it is generally thought to be onomatopoeia imitative of speech, similar to the related words \"jabber\" (to talk rapidly) and \"gibber\" (to speak inarticulately).\n\nAnother theory is that gibberish came from the name of a famous 8th-century Islamic alchemist, JÄbir ibn HayyÄn, whose name was Latinized as \"Geber.\" Thus, \"gibberish\" was a reference to the incomprehensible technical jargon used by Jabir and other alchemists. \n\nAnother theory, since discredited, asserts that it is derived from the Irish word \"gob\" or \"gab\" (mouth) or from the Irish phrase \"Geab ar ais\" (back talk, backward chat). The latter Irish etymology was suggested by Daniel Cassidy, whose work has been criticised by linguists and scholars. The terms \"geab\" and \"geabaire\" are certainly Irish words, but the phrase \"geab ar ais\" does not exist, and the word gibberish exists as a loan-word in Irish as \"gibiris\".\n\nThe term \"gobbledygook\" was coined by Maury Maverick, a former congressman from Texas and former mayor of San Antonio. When Maverick was chairman of the Smaller War Plants Corporation during World War II, he sent a memorandum that said: \"Be short and use Plain English. . . . Stay off gobbledygook language.\" Later, writing in the \"New York Times Magazine\", he defined gobbledygook as \"talk or writing which is long, pompous, vague, involved, usually with Latinized words.\" The allusion was to a turkey, \"always gobbledygobbling and strutting with ridiculous pomposity.\"\n\nThe term \"gobbledygook\" has a long history of usage in politics. Nixon's Oval Office tape from June 14, 1971, showed H. R. Haldeman describing a situation to Nixon as \"a bunch of gobbledygook. But out of the gobbledygook comes a very clear thing: you can't trust the government; you can't believe what they say.\" President Ronald Reagan explained tax law revisions in an address to the nation with the word, May 28, 1985, saying that \"most didnât improve the system; they made it more like Washington itself: complicated, unfair, cluttered with gobbledygook and loopholes designed for those with the power and influence to hire high-priced legal and tax advisers.\"\n\nMichael Shanks, former chairman to the National Consumer Council of Great Britain, characterizes professional gobbledygook as sloppy jargon intended to confuse nonspecialists: \"'Gobbledygook' may indicate a failure to think clearly, a contempt for one's clients, or more probably a mixture of both. A system that can't or won't communicate is not a safe basis for a democracy.\"\n\nUtilizing gibberish whilst acting can be used as an exercise in performance art education. Another usage of Gibberish is as part of Osho's \"Gibberish meditation\" which has been derived from an old Sufi practice.\n\nIn Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu the inscription on the base of an idol of Cthulhu is first described as \"gibberish\" because it consists of unpronounceable jumbles of consonants, not meant for human vocal organs. It is \"R'lyehese\" the language of the Great Old Ones and their minions.\n\nIn the Harry Potter novels, Gobbledygook is the language of the goblins, they speak English when dealing with humans at the bank in Diagon Alley.\n\nThe terms \"officialese\" or \"bureaucratese\" refer to language used by officials or authorities. \"Legalese\" is a closely related concept, referring to language used by lawyers, legislators, and others involved with the law. The language used in these fields may contain complex sentences and specialized jargon or buzzwords, making it difficult for those outside the field to understand. Speakers or writers of officialese or legalese may recognize that it is confusing or even meaningless to outsiders, but view its use as appropriate within their organization or group.\n\nBafflegab is a synonym, a slang term referring to confusing or a generally unintelligible use of jargon.\n\n", "id": "12407", "title": "Gibberish"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12408", "text": "Gnaeus Julius Agricola\n\nGnaeus Julius Agricola (; 13 June 40 â 23 August 93) was a Gallo-Roman general responsible for much of the Roman conquest of Britain. Written by his son-in-law Tacitus, the \"De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae\" is the primary source for most of what is known about him, along with detailed archaeological evidence from northern Britain.\n\nAgricola began his military career in Britain, serving under governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus. His subsequent career saw him serve in a variety of positions; he was appointed quaestor in Asia province in 64, then Plebeian Tribune in 66, and praetor in 68. He supported Vespasian during the Year of the Four Emperors (69), and was given a military command in Britain when the latter became emperor. When his command ended in 73, he was made patrician in Rome and appointed governor of Gallia Aquitania. He was made consul and governor of Britannia in 77. While there, he completed the conquest of what is now Wales and northern England, and led his army to the far north of Scotland, establishing forts across much of the Lowlands. He was recalled from Britain in 85 after an unusually lengthy service, and thereafter retired from military and public life.\n\nAgricola was born in the \"colonia\" of Forum Julii, Gallia Narbonensis (now FrÃ©jus, France). Agricola's parents were from noted Gallo-Roman political families of senatorial rank, his ancestors were Romanised Gauls of local origin. Both of his grandfathers served as imperial governors. His father, Lucius Julius Graecinus, was a \"praetor\" and had become a member of the Roman Senate in the year of his birth. Graecinus had become distinguished by his interest in philosophy. Between August 40 and January 41, the Roman Emperor Caligula ordered his death because he refused to prosecute the Emperor's second cousin Marcus Junius Silanus.\n\nHis mother was Julia Procilla. The Roman historian Tacitus describes her as \"a lady of singular virtue\". Tacitus states that Procilla had a fond affection for her son. Agricola was educated in Massilia (Marseille), and showed what was considered an unhealthy interest in philosophy.\n\nHe began his career in Roman public life as a military tribune, serving in Britain under Gaius Suetonius Paulinus from 58 to 62. He was probably attached to the \"Legio II Augusta\", but was chosen to serve on Suetonius's staff and thus almost certainly participated in the suppression of Boudica's uprising in 61.\n\nReturning from Britain to Rome in 62, he married Domitia Decidiana, a woman of noble birth. Their first child was a son. Agricola was appointed as \"quaestor\" for 64, which he served in the province of Asia under the corrupt proconsul Lucius Salvius Otho Titianus. While he was there, his daughter, Julia Agricola, was born, but his son died shortly afterwards. He was tribune of the plebs in 66 and \"praetor\" on June 68, during which time he was ordered by the Governor of Spain Galba to take an inventory of the temple treasures.\n\nIn June 68, the emperor Nero was deposed and committed suicide, and the period of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors began. Galba succeeded Nero, but was murdered in early 69 by Otho, who took the throne. Agricola's mother was murdered on her estate in Liguria by Otho's marauding fleet. Hearing of Vespasian's bid for the empire, Agricola immediately gave him his support. Otho meanwhile committed suicide after being defeated by Vitellius.\n\nAfter Vespasian had established himself as emperor, Agricola was appointed to the command of the \"Legio XX Valeria Victrix\", stationed in Britain, in place of Marcus Roscius Coelius, who had stirred up a mutiny against the governor, Marcus Vettius Bolanus. Britain had suffered revolt during the year of civil war, and Bolanus was a mild governor. Agricola reimposed discipline on the legion and helped to consolidate Roman rule. In 71, Bolanus was replaced by a more aggressive governor, Quintus Petillius Cerialis, and Agricola was able to display his talents as a commander in campaigns against the Brigantes in northern England.\n\nWhen his command ended in 73, Agricola was enrolled as a patrician and appointed to govern Gallia Aquitania. There he stayed for almost three years. In 76 or 77, he was recalled to Rome and appointed suffect consul, and betrothed his daughter to Tacitus. The following year, Tacitus and Julia married; Agricola was appointed to the College of Pontiffs, and returned to Britain for a third time, as its governor (\"Legatus Augusti pro praetore\").\n\nArriving in midsummer of 77, Agricola discovered that the Ordovices of north Wales had virtually destroyed the Roman cavalry stationed in their territory. He immediately moved against them and defeated them. He then moved north to the island of Mona (Anglesey), which Suetonius Paulinus had failed to subjugate in 60 because of the outbreak of the Boudican rebellion, and forced its inhabitants to sue for peace. He established a good reputation as an administrator, as well as a commander, by reforming the widely corrupt corn levy. He introduced Romanising measures, encouraging communities to build towns on the Roman model and educating the sons of the native nobility in the Roman manner.\n\nHe also expanded Roman rule north into Caledonia (modern Scotland). In the summer of 79, he pushed his armies to the estuary of the river Taus, usually interpreted as the Firth of Tay, virtually unchallenged, and established some forts. Though their location is left unspecified, the close dating of the fort at Elginhaugh in Midlothian makes it a possible candidate.\n\nIn 81, Agricola \"crossed in the first ship\" and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then. Tacitus, in Chapter 24 of \"Agricola\", does not tell us what body of water he crossed, although most scholars believe it was the Clyde or Forth, and some translators even add the name of their preferred river to the text; however, the rest of the chapter exclusively concerns Ireland, so southwest Scotland is perhaps to be preferred. The text of the \"Agricola\" has been amended here to record the Romans \"crossing into trackless wastes\", referring to the wilds of the Galloway peninsula. Agricola fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and auxiliaries. He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest. This conquest never happened, but some historians believe the crossing referred to was in fact a small-scale exploratory or punitive expedition to Ireland, though no Roman camps have been identified to confirm such a suggestion.\n\nIrish legend provides a striking parallel. Tuathal Teachtmhar, a legendary High King, is said to have been exiled from Ireland as a boy, and to have returned from Britain at the head of an army to claim the throne. The traditional date of his return is 76â80, and archaeology has found Roman or Romano-British artefacts in several sites associated with Tuathal.\n\nThe following year, Agricola raised a fleet and encircled the tribes beyond the Forth, and the Caledonians rose in great numbers against him. They attacked the camp of the \"Legio IX Hispana\" at night, but Agricola sent in his cavalry and they were put to flight. The Romans responded by pushing further north. Another son was born to Agricola this year, but he died before his first birthday.\n\nIn the summer of 83, Agricola faced the massed armies of the Caledonians, led by Calgacus, at the Battle of Mons Graupius. Tacitus estimates their numbers at more than 30,000. Agricola put his auxiliaries in the front line, keeping the legions in reserve, and relied on close-quarters fighting to make the Caledonians' unpointed slashing swords useless as they were unable to swing them properly or utilise thrusting attacks. Even though the Caledonians were put to rout and therefore lost this battle, two thirds of their army managed to escape and hide in the Highlands or the \"trackless wilds\" as Tacitus calls them. Battle casualties were estimated by Tacitus to be about 10,000 on the Caledonian side and 360 on the Roman side.\n\nA number of authors have reckoned the battle to have occurred in the Grampian Mounth within sight of the North Sea. In particular, Roy, Surenne, Watt, Hogan and others have advanced notions that the site of the battle may have been Kempstone Hill, Megray Hill or other knolls near the Raedykes Roman camp; these points of high ground are proximate to the Elsick Mounth, an ancient trackway used by Romans and Caledonians for military manoeuvres. However, following the discovery of the Roman camp at Durno in 1975, most scholars now believe that the battle took place on the ground around Bennachie in Aberdeenshire.\n\nSatisfied with his victory, Agricola extracted hostages from the Caledonian tribes. He may have marched his army to the northern coast of Britain, as evidenced by the probable discovery of a Roman fort at Cawdor (near Inverness).\n\nHe also instructed the prefect of the fleet to sail around the north coast, confirming (allegedly for the first time) that Britain was in fact an island.\n\nAgricola was recalled from Britain in 85, after an unusually long tenure as governor. Tacitus claims Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola's successes outshone the Emperor's own modest victories in Germany. He re-entered Rome unobtrusively, reporting as ordered to the palace at night. The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear; on the one hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue (the highest military honours apart from an actual triumph); on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post, in spite of his experience and renown. He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa, but declined it, whether due to ill health or (as Tacitus claims) the machinations of Domitian.\nIn 93, Agricola died on his family estates in Gallia Narbonensis aged fifty-three. Rumours circulated attributing the death to a poison administered by the Emperor Domitian, but no positive evidence for this was ever produced.\n\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "12408", "title": "Gnaeus Julius Agricola"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12420", "text": "GÃ¶del's ontological proof\n\nGÃ¶del's ontological proof is a formal argument by the mathematician Kurt GÃ¶del (1906â1978) for God's existence. More precisely, it presupposes the notion of \"positive\" and \"negative\" properties, and proves the necessary existence of an object which each positive property, but no negative property, applies to.\n\nThe argument is in a line of development that goes back to Anselm of Canterbury (1033â1109). St. Anselm's ontological argument, in its most succinct form, is as follows: \"God, by definition, is that for which no greater can be conceived. God exists in the understanding. If God exists in the understanding, we could imagine Him to be greater by existing in reality. Therefore, God must exist.\" A more elaborate version was given by Gottfried Leibniz (1646â1716); this is the version that GÃ¶del studied and attempted to clarify with his ontological argument.\n\nGÃ¶del left a fourteen-point outline of his philosophical beliefs in his papers. Points relevant to the ontological proof include\n\nThe first version of the ontological proof in GÃ¶del's papers is dated \"around 1941\". GÃ¶del is not known to have told anyone about his work on the proof until 1970, when he thought he was dying. In February, he allowed Dana Scott to copy out a version of the proof, which circulated privately. In August 1970, GÃ¶del told Oskar Morgenstern that he was \"satisfied\" with the proof, but Morgenstern recorded in his diary entry for 29 August 1970, that GÃ¶del would not publish because he was afraid that others might think \"that he actually believes in God, whereas he is only engaged in a logical investigation (that is, in showing that such a proof with classical assumptions (completeness, etc.) correspondingly axiomatized, is possible).\" GÃ¶del died January 14, 1978. Another version, slightly different from Scott's, was found in his papers. It was finally published, together with Scott's version, in 1987.\n\nMorgenstern's diary is an important and usually reliable source for GÃ¶del's later years, but the implication of the August 1970 diary entryâthat GÃ¶del did not believe in Godâis not consistent with the other evidence. In letters to his mother, who was not a churchgoer and had raised Kurt and his brother as freethinkers, GÃ¶del argued at length for a belief in an afterlife. He did the same in an interview with a skeptical Hao Wang, who said: \"I expressed my doubts as G spoke [...] GÃ¶del smiled as he replied to my questions, obviously aware that his answers were not convincing me.\" Wang reports that GÃ¶del's wife, Adele, two days after GÃ¶del's death, told Wang that \"GÃ¶del, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning.\" In an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, GÃ¶del described his religion as \"baptized Lutheran (but not member of any religious congregation). My belief is \"theistic\", not pantheistic, following Leibniz rather than Spinoza.\"\n\nThe proof uses modal logic, which distinguishes between \"necessary\" truths and \"contingent\" truths. In the most common semantics for modal logic, many \"possible worlds\" are considered. A truth is \"necessary\" if it is true in all possible worlds. By contrast, a truth is \"contingent\" if it just happens to be the case. For instance, \"more than half of this planet is covered by water\" is a contingent truth, that relies upon which planet \"this planet\" is. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is false in another world, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some world (not necessarily our own) is called a \"possible\" truth.\n\nFurthermore, the proof uses higher-order (modal) logic because the definition of God employs an explicit quantification over properties.\n\nFirst, GÃ¶del axiomatizes the notion of a \"positive property\": for each property \"Ï\", either \"Ï\" or its negation Â¬\"Ï\" must be positive, but not both (axiom 2). If a positive property \"Ï\" implies a property \"Ï\" in each possible world, then \"Ï\" is positive, too (axiom 1). GÃ¶del then argues that each positive property is \"possibly exemplified\", i.e. applies at least to some object in some world (theorem 1). Defining an object to be Godlike if it has all positive properties (definition 1), and requiring that property to be positive itself (axiom 3), GÃ¶del shows that in \"some\" possible world a Godlike object exists (theorem 2), called \"God\" in the following. GÃ¶del proceeds to prove that a Godlike object exists in \"every\" possible world.\n\nTo this end, he defines \"essences\": if \"x\" is an object in some world, then a property \"Ï\" is said to be an essence of \"x\" if \"Ï\"(\"x\") is true in that world and if \"Ï\" necessarily entails all other properties that \"x\" has in that world (definition 2). Requiring positive properties being positive in every possible world (axiom 4), GÃ¶del can show that Godlikeness is an essence of every Godlike object (theorem 3). Now, \"x\" is said to \"exist necessarily\" if for every essence \"Ï\" of \"x\" the following is true: in every possible world, there is an element \"y\" with property \"Ï\" (definition 3). Axiom 5 requires necessary existence to be a positive property.\n\nHence, it must follow from Godlikeness. Moreover, Godlikeness is an essence of God, since it entails all positive properties, and any nonpositive property is the negation of some positive property, so God cannot have any nonpositive properties. Since any Godlike object is necessarily existent, it follows that any Godlike object in one world is a Godlike object in all worlds, by the definition of necessary existence. Given the existence of a Godlike object in one world, proven above, we may conclude that there is a Godlike object in every possible world, as required (theorem 4). Besides axiom 1-5 and definition 1-3, a few other axioms from modal logic were tacitly used in the proof.\n\nFrom these hypotheses, it is also possible to prove that there is only one God in each world by Leibniz's law, the identity of indiscernibles: two or more objects are identical (the same) if they have all their properties in common, and so, there would only be one object in each world that possesses property G. GÃ¶del did not attempt to do so however, as he purposely limited his proof to the issue of existence, rather than uniqueness. This was more to preserve the logical precision of the argument than due to a penchant for polytheism. This uniqueness proof will only work if one supposes that the positiveness of a property is independent of the object to which it is applied, a claim which some have considered to be suspect .\n\nformula_1\n\nThere is an ongoing open-source effort to formalize GÃ¶del's proof to a level that is suitable for automated theorem proving or at least computer verification via proof assistants. The effort made headlines in German newspapers. According to the authors of this effort, they were inspired by Melvin Fitting's book.\n\nMost criticism of GÃ¶del's proof is aimed at its axioms: As with any proof in any logical system, if the axioms the proof depends on are doubted, then the conclusions can be doubted. This is particularly applicable to GÃ¶del's proof, because it rests on five axioms that are all questionable. The proof does not say that the conclusion has to be correct, but rather that if you accept the axioms, then the conclusion is correct.\n\nMany philosophers have questioned the axioms. The first layer of attack is simply that there are no arguments presented that give reasons why the axioms are true. A second layer is that these particular axioms lead to unwelcome conclusions. This line of thought was argued by Jordan Howard Sobel, showing that if the axioms are accepted, they lead to a \"modal collapse\" where every statement that is true is necessarily true, i.e. the sets of necessary, of contingent, and of possible truths all coincide (provided there are accessible worlds at all). According to Koons, Sobel suggested that GÃ¶del might have welcomed modal collapse.\n\nThere are suggested amendments to the proof, presented by C. Anthony Anderson, but argued to be refutable by Anderson and Michael Gettings. Sobel's proof of modal collapse has been questioned by Robert Koons, but a counter-defence by Sobel has been given. In 2014, Christoph BenzmÃ¼ller and Bruno Woltzenlogel-Paleo gave a computer-checked proof of modal collapse. In the same paper, they suspected GÃ¶del's original version of the axioms to be inconsistent; in 2016, they gave a computer proof that this version implies formula_2, i.e. is inconsistent in every modal logic with a reflexive or symmetric accessibility relation.\n\nGÃ¶del's proof has also been questioned by Graham Oppy, asking whether lots of other almost-gods would also be \"proven\" by GÃ¶del's axioms. This counter-argument has been questioned by Gettings, who agrees that the axioms might be questioned, but disagrees that Oppy's particular counter-example can be shown from GÃ¶del's axioms.\n\nThere are many more criticisms, most focusing on the philosophically interesting question of whether these axioms \"must\" be rejected to avoid odd conclusions. The broader criticism is that even if the axioms cannot be shown to be false, that does not mean that they are true. Hilbert's famous remark about interchangeability of the primitives' names applies to those in GÃ¶del's ontological axioms (\"\"positive\", \"god-like\", \"essence\"\") as well as to those in Hilbert's geometry axioms (\"\"point\", \"line\", \"plane\"\"). According to (2005) it remains to show that the dazzling notion prescribed by traditions and often believed to be essentially mysterious satisfies GÃ¶del's axioms. This is not a mathematical, but merely a theological task. It is this task which decides which religion's god has been proven to exist.\n\nA humorous variant of GÃ¶del's Ontological proof is mentioned in Quentin Canterel's novel \"The Jolly Coroner\"\n\n\n\n", "id": "12420", "title": "GÃ¶del's ontological proof"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12424", "text": "Genetic programming\n\nIn artificial intelligence, genetic programming (GP) is a technique whereby computer programs are encoded as a set of genes that are then modified (evolved) using an evolutionary algorithm (often a genetic algorithm, \"GA\") â it is an application of (for example) genetic algorithms where the space of solutions consists of computer programs. The results are computer programs able to perform well in a predefined task. The methods used to encode a computer program in an artificial chromosome and to evaluate its fitness with respect to the predefined task are central in the GP technique and still the subject of active research.\n\nIn 1954, pioneering work on what is today known as artificial life was carried out by Nils Aall Barricelli using the very early computers. In the 1960s and early 1970s, evolutionary algorithms became widely recognized as optimization methods. Ingo Rechenberg and his group were able to solve complex engineering problems through evolution strategies as documented in his 1971 PhD thesis and the resulting 1973 book. John Holland was highly influential during the 1970s. The establishment of evolutionary algorithms in the scientific community allowed, by then, the first concrete steps to study the GP idea.\n\nIn 1964, Lawrence J. Fogel, one of the earliest practitioners of the GP methodology, applied evolutionary algorithms to the problem of discovering finite-state automata. Later GP-related work grew out of the learning classifier system community, which developed sets of sparse rules describing optimal policies for Markov decision processes. \nIn 1981 Richard Forsyth evolved tree rules to classify heart disease.\nThe first statement of modern \"tree-based\" genetic programming (that is, procedural languages organized in tree-based structures and operated on by suitably defined GA-operators) was given by Nichael L. Cramer (1985). This work was later greatly expanded by John R. Koza, a main proponent of GP who has pioneered the application of genetic programming in various complex optimization and search problems. Gianna Giavelli, a student of Koza's, later pioneered the use of genetic programming as a technique to model DNA expression.\n\nIn the 1990s, GP was mainly used to solve relatively simple problems because it is very computationally intensive. Recently GP has produced many novel and outstanding results in areas such as quantum computing, electronic design, game playing, cyberterrorism prevention, sorting, and searching, due to improvements in GP technology and the exponential growth in CPU power.\nThese results include the replication or development of several post-year-2000 inventions. GP has also been applied to evolvable hardware as well as computer programs.\n\nDeveloping a theory for GP has been very difficult and so in the 1990s GP was considered a sort of outcast among search techniques.\n\nGP evolves computer programs, traditionally represented in memory as tree structures. Trees can be easily evaluated in a recursive manner. Every tree node has an operator function and every terminal node has an operand, making mathematical expressions easy to evolve and evaluate. Thus traditionally GP favors the use of programming languages that naturally embody tree structures (for example, Lisp; other functional programming languages are also suitable).\n\nNon-tree representations have been suggested and successfully implemented, such as linear genetic programming which suits the more traditional imperative languages [see, for example, Banzhaf \"et al.\" (1998)]. The commercial GP software \"Discipulus\" uses automatic induction of binary machine code (\"AIM\") to achieve better performance. \"ÂµGP\" uses directed multigraphs to generate programs that fully exploit the syntax of a given assembly language\n\nMost non-tree representations have structurally noneffective code (introns). Such non-coding genes may seem to be useless, because they have no effect on the performance of any one individual.\nHowever, experiments seem to show faster convergence when using program representations â such as linear genetic programming and Cartesian genetic programming â that allow such non-coding genes, compared to tree-based program representations that do not have any non-coding genes.\n\nThe basic ideas of genetic programming have been modified and extended in a variety of ways:\n\nMeta-genetic programming is the proposed meta learning technique of evolving a genetic programming system using genetic programming itself. It suggests that chromosomes, crossover, and mutation were themselves evolved, therefore like their real life counterparts should be allowed to change on their own rather than being determined by a human programmer. Meta-GP was formally proposed by JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber in 1987. Doug Lenat's Eurisko is an earlier effort that may be the same technique. It is a recursive but terminating algorithm, allowing it to avoid infinite recursion.\n\nCritics of this idea often say this approach is overly broad in scope. However, it might be possible to constrain the fitness criterion onto a general class of results, and so obtain an evolved GP that would more efficiently produce results for sub-classes. This might take the form of a meta evolved GP for producing human walking algorithms which is then used to evolve human running, jumping, etc. The fitness criterion applied to the meta GP would simply be one of efficiency.\n\nFor general problem classes there may be no way to show that meta GP will reliably produce results more efficiently than a created algorithm other than exhaustion.\n\n\n", "id": "12424", "title": "Genetic programming"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12425", "text": "Gustav Klimt\n\nGustav Klimt (July 14, 1862 â February 6, 1918) was an Austrian symbolist painter and one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement. Klimt is noted for his paintings, murals, sketches, and other objets d'art. Klimt's primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked by a frank eroticism. In addition to his figurative works, which include allegories and portraits, he painted landscapes. Among the artists of the Vienna Secession, Klimt was the most influenced by Japanese art and its methods.\n\nEarly in his artistic career, he was a successful painter of architectural decorations in a conventional manner. As he developed a more personal style, his work was the subject of controversy that culminated when the paintings he completed around 1900 for the ceiling of the Great Hall of the University of Vienna were criticized as pornographic. He subsequently accepted no more public commissions, but achieved a new success with the paintings of his \"golden phase\", many of which include gold leaf. Klimt's work was an important influence on his younger contemporary Egon Schiele.\n\nGustav Klimt was born in Baumgarten, near Vienna in Austria-Hungary, the second of seven childrenâthree boys and four girls. His mother, Anna Klimt (\"nÃ©e\" Finster), had an unrealized ambition to be a musical performer. His father, Ernst Klimt the Elder, formerly from Bohemia, was a gold engraver. All three of their sons displayed artistic talent early on. Klimt's younger brothers were Ernst Klimt and Georg Klimt.\n\nKlimt lived in poverty while attending the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts (\"Kunstgewerbeschule\"), where he studied architectural painting until 1883. He revered Vienna's foremost history painter of the time, Hans Makart. Klimt readily accepted the principles of a conservative training; his early work may be classified as academic. In 1877 his brother, Ernst, who, like his father, would become an engraver, also enrolled in the school. The two brothers and their friend, Franz Matsch, began working together and by 1880 they had received numerous commissions as a team that they called the \"Company of Artists\". They also helped their teacher in painting murals in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Klimt began his professional career painting interior murals and ceilings in large public buildings on the RingstraÃe, including a successful series of \"Allegories and Emblems\".\n\nIn 1888 Klimt received the Golden Order of Merit from Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria for his contributions to murals painted in the Burgtheater in Vienna. He also became an honorary member of the University of Munich and the University of Vienna. In 1892 Klimt's father and brother Ernst both died, and he had to assume financial responsibility for his father's and brother's families. The tragedies also affected his artistic vision and soon he would move towards a new personal style. \nCharacteristic of his style at the end of the 19th century is the inclusion of \"Nuda Veritas\" (\"nude truth\") as a symbolic figure in some of his works, including \"Ancient Greece and Egypt\" (1891), \"Pallas Athene\" (1898) and \"Nuda Veritas\" (1899). Historians believe that Klimt with the \"nuda veritas\" denounced both the policy of the Habsburgs and the Austrian society, which ignored all political and social problems of that time. \nIn the early 1890s Klimt met Austrian fashion designer Emilie Louise FlÃ¶ge (a sibling of his sister-in-law) who was to be his companion until the end of his life. His painting, \"The Kiss\" (1907â08), is thought to be an image of them as lovers. He designed many costumes she created and modeled in his works.\n\nDuring this period Klimt fathered at least fourteen children.\n\nKlimt became one of the founding members and president of the \"Wiener Sezession\" (Vienna Secession) in 1897 and of the group's periodical, \"Ver Sacrum\" (\"Sacred Spring\"). He remained with the Secession until 1908. The goals of the group were to provide exhibitions for unconventional young artists, to bring the works of the best foreign artists to Vienna, and to publish its own magazine to showcase the work of members. The group declared no manifesto and did not set out to encourage any particular styleâNaturalists, Realists, and Symbolists all coexisted. The government supported their efforts and gave them a lease on public land to erect an exhibition hall. The group's symbol was Pallas Athena, the Greek goddess of just causes, wisdom, and the artsâof whom Klimt painted his radical version in 1898.\n\nIn 1894, Klimt was commissioned to create three paintings to decorate the ceiling of the Great Hall of the University of Vienna. Not completed until the turn of the century, his three paintings, \"Philosophy\", \"Medicine\", and \"Jurisprudence\" were criticized for their radical themes and material, and were called \"pornographic\". Klimt had transformed traditional allegory and symbolism into a new language that was more overtly sexual and hence more disturbing to some. The public outcry came from all quartersâpolitical, aesthetic and religious. As a result, the paintings \"(seen in gallery below)\" were not displayed on the ceiling of the Great Hall. This would be the last public commission accepted by the artist.\n\nAll three paintings were destroyed by retreating SS forces in May 1945.\n\nHis \"Nuda Veritas\" (1899) defined his bid to further \"shake up\" the establishment. The starkly naked red-headed woman holds the mirror of truth, while above her is a quotation by Friedrich Schiller in stylized lettering, \"\"If you cannot please everyone with your deeds and your art, please only a few. To please many is bad.\"\"\n\nIn 1902, Klimt finished the \"Beethoven Frieze\" for the Fourteenth Vienna Secessionist exhibition, which was intended to be a celebration of the composer and featured a monumental polychrome sculpture by Max Klinger. Intended for the exhibition only, the frieze was painted directly on the walls with light materials. After the exhibition the painting was preserved, although it was not displayed again until 1986. The face on the Beethoven portrait resembled the composer and Vienna Court Opera director Gustav Mahler.\n\nDuring this period Klimt did not confine himself to public commissions. Beginning in the late 1890s he took annual summer holidays with the FlÃ¶ge family on the shores of Attersee and painted many of his landscapes there. These landscapes constitute the only genre aside from figure painting that seriously interested Klimt. In recognition of his intensity, the locals called him Waldschrat (\"Forest demon\").\n\nKlimt's Attersee paintings are of sufficient number and quality as to merit separate appreciation. Formally, the landscapes are characterized by the same refinement of design and emphatic patterning as the figural pieces. Deep space in the Attersee works is flattened so efficiently to a single plane, that it is believed that Klimt painted them by using a telescope.\n\nKlimt's 'Golden Phase' was marked by positive critical reaction and financial success. Many of his paintings from this period included gold leaf. Klimt had previously used gold in his \"Pallas Athene\" (1898) and \"Judith I\" (1901), although the works most popularly associated with this period are the \"Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I\" (1907) and \"The Kiss\" (1907â08).\n\nKlimt travelled little, but trips to Venice and Ravenna, both famous for their beautiful mosaics, most likely inspired his gold technique and his Byzantine imagery. In 1904, he collaborated with other artists on the lavish Palais Stoclet, the home of a wealthy Belgian industrialist that was one of the grandest monuments of the Art Nouveau age. Klimt's contributions to the dining room, including both \"Fulfillment\" and \"Expectation\", were some of his finest decorative works, and as he publicly stated, \"probably the ultimate stage of my development of ornament.\"\n\nIn 1905, Klimt created a painted portrait of Margarete Wittgenstein, Ludwig Wittgenstein's sister, on the occasion of her marriage. Then, between 1907 and 1909, Klimt painted five canvases of society women wrapped in fur. His apparent love of costume is expressed in the many photographs of FlÃ¶ge modeling clothing he had designed.\n\nAs he worked and relaxed in his home, Klimt normally wore sandals and a long robe with no undergarments. His simple life was somewhat cloistered, devoted to his art, family, and little else except the Secessionist Movement. He avoided cafÃ© society and seldom socialized with other artists. Klimt's fame usually brought patrons to his door and he could afford to be highly selective. His painting method was very deliberate and painstaking at times and he required lengthy sittings by his subjects. Although very active sexually, he kept his affairs discreet and he avoided personal scandal.\n\nKlimt wrote little about his vision or his methods. He wrote mostly postcards to FlÃ¶ge and kept no diary. In a rare writing called \"Commentary on a non-existent self-portrait\", he states \"I have never painted a self-portrait. I am less interested in myself as a subject for a painting than I am in other people, above all women... There is nothing special about me. I am a painter who paints day after day from morning to night... Who ever wants to know something about me... ought to look carefully at my pictures.\"\n\nIn 1901 Herman Bahr wrote, in his \"Speech on Klimt\": \"Just as only a lover can reveal to a man what life means to him and develop its innermost significance, I feel the same about these paintings.\"\n\nIn 1911 his painting \"Death and Life\" received first prize in the world exhibitions in Rome. In 1915 Anna, his mother, died. Klimt died three years later in Vienna on February 6, 1918, having suffered a stroke and pneumonia due to the worldwide influenza epidemic of that year. He was buried at the Hietzinger Cemetery in Hietzing, Vienna. Numerous paintings by him were left unfinished.\n\nKlimt's paintings have brought some of the highest prices recorded for individual works of art. In November 2003, Klimt's \"Landhaus am Attersee\" sold for $29,128,000, but that sale was soon eclipsed by prices paid for other Klimts.\n\nIn 2006, the 1907 portrait, \"Adele Bloch-Bauer I\", was purchased for the Neue Galerie New York by Ronald Lauder reportedly for US $135 million, surpassing Picasso's 1905 \"Boy With a Pipe\" (sold May 5, 2004 for $104 million), as the highest reported price ever paid for a painting.\n\nOn August 7, 2006, Christie's auction house announced it was handling the sale of the remaining four works by Klimt that were recovered by Maria Altmann and her co-heirs after their long legal battle against Austria (see Republic of Austria v. Altmann). Maria Altmanns fight to regain her family's paintings has been the subject of a number of documentary films including \"Adele's Wish\". Her struggle also became the subject of the dramatic film the \"Woman in Gold\", a movie inspired by \"Stealing Klimt\", the documentary featuring Maria Altmann herself. The portrait of \"Adele Bloch-Bauer II\" was sold at auction in November 2006 for $88 million, the third-highest priced piece of art at auction at the time. \"The Apple Tree I\" (ca. 1912) sold for $33 million, \"Birch Forest\" (1903) sold for $40.3 million, and \"Houses in Unterach on Lake Atter\" (1916) sold for $31 million. Collectively, the five restituted paintings netted more than $327 million. The painting \"Litzlberg am Attersee\" was auctioned for $40.4 million at Sotheby's in November 2011.\n\nThe city of Vienna, Austria had many special exhibitions commemorating the 150th anniversary of Klimt's birth in 2012.\n\nThe only folio set produced in Klimt's lifetime, \"Das Werk Gustav Klimts\", was published initially by H. O. Miethke (of Gallerie Miethke, Klimt's exclusive gallery in Vienna) from 1908 to 1914 in an edition of 300, supervised personally by the artist. The first thirty-five editions (I-XXXV) each included an original drawing by Klimt, and the next thirty-five editions (XXXVI-LXX) each with a facsimile signature on the title page. Fifty images depicting Klimt's most important paintings (1893â1913) were reproduced using collotype lithography and mounted on a heavy, cream-colored wove paper with deckled edges. Thirty-one of the images (ten of which are multicolored) are printed on \"Chine-collÃ©\". The remaining nineteen are high quality halftones prints. Each piece was marked with a unique signetâdesigned by Klimtâwhich was impressed into the wove paper in gold metallic ink. The prints were issued in groups of ten to subscribers, in unbound black paper folders embossed with Klimt's name. Because of the delicate nature of collotype lithography, as well as the necessity for multicolored prints (a feat difficult to reproduce with collotypes), and Klimt's own desire for perfection, the series that was published in mid-1908 was not completed until 1914.\n\nEach of the fifty prints was categorized among five themes:\n\nThe monochrome collotypes as well as the halftone works were printed with a variety of colored inks ranging from sepia to blue and green. Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria was the first to purchase a folio set of \"Das Werk Gustav Klimts\" in 1908.\n\n\"FÃ¼nfundzwanzig Handzeichnungen\" (\"Twenty-five Drawings\") was released the year after Klimt's death. Many of the drawings in the collection were erotic in nature and just as polarizing as his painted works. Published in Vienna in 1919 by Gilhofer & Ranschburg, the edition of 500 features twenty-five monochrome and two-color collotype reproductions, nearly indistinguishable from the original works. While the set was released a year after Klimt's death, some art historians suspect he was involved with production planning due to the meticulous nature of the printing (Klimt had overseen the production of the plates for \"Das Werk Gustav Klimts\", making sure each one was to his exact specifications, a level of quality carried through similarly in \"FÃ¼nfundzwanzig Handzeichnungen\"). The first ten editions also each contained an original Klimt drawing.\n\nMany of the works contained in this volume depict erotic scenes of nude women, some of whom are masturbating alone or are coupled in sapphic embraces. When a number of the original drawings were exhibited to the public, at Gallerie Miethke in 1910 and the International Exhibition of Prints and Drawings in Vienna in 1913, they were met by critics and viewers who were hostile towards Klimt's contemporary perspective. There was an audience for Klimt's erotic drawings, however, and fifteen of his drawings were selected by Viennese poet Franz Blei for his translation of Hellenistic satirist Lucian's \"Dialogues of the Courteseans\". The book, limited to 450 copies, provided Klimt the opportunity to show these more lurid depictions of women and avoided censorship thanks to an audience composed of a small group of (mostly male) affluent patrons.\n\nComposed in 1931 by editor Max Eisler and printed by the Austrian State Printing Office, \"Gustav Klimt An Aftermath\" was intended to complete the lifetime folio \"Das Werk Gustav Klimts\". The folio contains thirty colored collotypes (fourteen of which are multicolored) and follows a similar format found in \"Das Werk Gustav Klimts\", replacing the unique Klimt-designed signets with gold-debossed plate numbers. One hundred and fifty sets were produced in English, with twenty of them (Nos. IâXX) presented as a \"gala edition\" bound in gilt leather. The set contains detailed images from previously released works (Hygeia from the University Mural \"Medicine\", 1901; a section of the third University Mural \"Jurisprudence\", 1903), as well as the unfinished paintings (\"Adam and Eve\", \"Bridal Progress\").\n\nAccording to the writer Frank Whitford: \"Klimt of course, is an important artistâhe's a very \"popular\" artistâbut in terms of the history of art, he's a very unimportant artist. Although he sums up so much in his work, about the society in which he found himselfâin art historical terms his effect was negligible. So he's an artist really in a cul-de-sac.\" Klimt's work had a strong influence on the paintings of Egon Schiele, with whom he would collaborate to found the \"Kunsthalle\" (Hall of Art) in 1917, to try to keep local artists from going abroad. Artists who reinterpreted Klimt's work include Slovak artist Rudolf Fila.\n\nWriters who have been inspired by Klimt include the Romanian poet Sebastian Reichmann, who in 2008 published a book called \"Mocheta lui Klimt\" (\"Klimt's Carpet\"). As the author says in an interview, and in one of the poems from the book, the title was inspired by a carpet that reminded him of Klimt's paintings. The book's front cover depicts an Art Nouveau-styled passage from Bucharest.\nSouth Korean novelist Kim Young-ha frequently refers to Klimt, particularly \"Judith\", in his first novel \"I Have The Right To Destroy Myself\". One of the main characters in this novel is referred to by the other characters as Judith because of her resemblance to Klimt's painting.\n\n\"Klimt\" is a musical composition by Claudio Ottaviano Trio included in the album \"Notturno\" (NuomRecords 2013). \nJapanese rock band Buck-Tick based the cover artwork of their 2012 album, \"Yume Miru Uchuu\", on Klimt's \"Gold Fish\".\n\nSeveral of Klimt's most famous works from his golden period inspired the title sequence for the animated adaptation of the manga series, \"Elfen Lied\", in which the art is recreated to fit with the series' own characters and is arranged as a montage with the song \"Lilium\". The opening to the anime \"Sound of the Sky\" also is largely inspired by Klimt's works, which was also directed by the same director as \"Elfen Lied\". The design of the land of Centopia on the TV series \"Mia and Me\" is inspired by Klimt's works. The art of the video game Transistor also uses patterns and embellishments inspired by Klimt.\n\nCouturier John Galliano found inspiration for the Christian Dior Spring-Summer 2008 haute couture collection in Klimt's work.\n\nGustav Klimt and his work have been the subjects of many collector coins and medals, such as the 100 Euro Painting Gold Coin, issued on November 5, 2003, by the Austrian Mint. The obverse depicts Klimt in his studio with two unfinished paintings on easels.\n\nIn addition to the permanent exhibitions on display, the city of Vienna, Austria celebrated the 150th anniversary of the birth of Klimt with special exhibitions throughout the city. Guided walking tours through the city allowed people to see some of the buildings where Klimt worked.\n\nGoogle commemorated Gustav Klimt with a Google doodle celebrating Klimt's painting \"The Kiss\" on his 150th birthday, 14 July 2012.\n\nIn 2012, the Austrian Mint began a five-coin gold series to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Klimt's birth. The first 50 Euro gold coin was issued on January 25, 2012 and featured a portrait of Klimt on the obverse and a portion of his painting of Adele Bloch-Bauer.\n\nIn 2013, the Gustav Klimt Foundation was set up by Ursula Ucicky, widow of Klimt's illegitimate son Gustav Ucicky, with a mission to \"preserve and disseminate Gustav Klimt's legacy.\" The managing director of the Leopold Museum, Peter WeinhÃ¤upl, was appointed as Chairman of the foundation. As a reaction, the museum's director Tobias G. Natter resigned in protest, citing Ucicky's past as a Nazi propaganda film-maker.\n\n\n\n", "id": "12425", "title": "Gustav Klimt"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12426", "text": "Groucho Marx\n\nJulius Henry Marx (October 2, 1890 â August 19, 1977), known professionally as Groucho Marx (), was an American comedian, film and television star. He was known as a master of quick wit and is widely considered one of the best comedians of the modern era. His rapid-fire, often impromptu delivery of innuendo-laden patter earned him many admirers and imitators.\n\nHe made 13 feature films with his siblings the Marx Brothers, of whom he was the third-born. He also had a successful solo career, most notably as the host of the radio and television game show \"You Bet Your Life\".\n\nHis distinctive appearance, carried over from his days in vaudeville, included quirks such as an exaggerated stooped posture, glasses, cigar, and a thick greasepaint mustache and eyebrows. These exaggerated features resulted in the creation of one of the world's most ubiquitous and recognizable novelty disguises, known as Groucho glasses: a one-piece mask consisting of horn-rimmed glasses, large plastic nose, bushy eyebrows and mustache.\n\nJulius Marx was born on October 2, 1890, in Manhattan, New York City.\n\nMarx stated that he was born in a room above a butcher's shop on East 78th Street in Manhattan, New York City, \"Between Lexington & 3rd\", as told to Dick Cavett in a 1969 television interview. The Marx children grew up on East 93rd Street off Lexington Avenue in a neighborhood now known as Carnegie Hill on the Upper East Side of the borough of Manhattan, in New York City. The turn-of-the-century building that his brother Harpo called \"the first real home they ever knew\" (in his memoir \"Harpo Speaks\") was populated with European immigrants, mostly artisans. Just across the street were the oldest brownstones in the area, owned by people such as the well-connected Loew Brothers and William Orth. The Marx family lived at this location \"for about 14 years\", Groucho also told Cavett.\nMarx's family was Jewish. Groucho's mother was Miene \"Minnie\" Schoenberg, whose family came from Dornum in northern Germany when she was 16 years old. His father was Simon \"Sam\" Marx, who changed his name from Marrix, and was called \"Frenchie\" by his sons throughout his life because he and his family came from Alsace in France. Minnie's brother was Al Schoenberg, who shortened his name to Al Shean when he went into show business as half of Gallagher and Shean, a noted vaudeville act of the early 20th century. According to Groucho, when Shean visited he would throw the local waifs a few coins so that when he knocked at the door he would be surrounded by adoring fans. Marx and his brothers respected his opinions and asked him on several occasions to write some material for them.\n\nMinnie Marx did not have an entertainment industry career but had intense ambition for her sons to go on the stage like their uncle. While pushing her eldest son Leonard (Chico Marx) in piano lessons she found that Julius had a pleasant soprano voice and the ability to remain on key. Julius's early career goal was to become a doctor, but the family's need for income forced him out of school at the age of twelve. By that time young Julius had become a voracious reader, particularly fond of Horatio Alger. Marx would continue to overcome his lack of formal education by becoming very well-read.\n\nAfter a few stabs at entry-level office work and jobs suitable for adolescents, Julius took to the stage as a boy singer with the Gene Leroy Trio, debuting at the Ramona Theatre in Grand Rapids, MI on July 16, 1905. Marx reputedly claimed that he was \"hopelessly average\" as a vaudevillian, but this was typically Marx, wisecracking in his true form. By 1909 Minnie Marx had assembled her sons into a forgettable-quality vaudeville singing group billed as \"The Four Nightingales\". The brothers Julius, Milton (Gummo Marx) and Arthur (originally Adolph, from 1911 Harpo Marx) and another boy singer, Lou Levy, traveled the U.S. vaudeville circuits to little fanfare. After exhausting their prospects in the East the family moved to La Grange, Illinois, to play the Midwest.\nAfter a particularly dispiriting performance in Nacogdoches, Texas, Julius, Milton, and Arthur began cracking jokes onstage for their own amusement. Much to their surprise, the audience liked them better as comedians than as singers. They modified the then-popular Gus Edwards comedy skit \"School Days\" and renamed it \"Fun In Hi Skule\". The Marx Brothers would perform variations on this routine for the next seven years.\n\nFor a time in vaudeville all the brothers performed using ethnic accents. Leonard, the oldest, developed the Italian accent he used as Chico Marx to convince some roving bullies that he was Italian, not Jewish. Arthur, the next oldest, donned a curly red wig and became \"Patsy Brannigan\", a stereotypical Irish character. His discomfort speaking on stage led to his uncle Al Shean's suggestion that he stop speaking altogether and play the role in mime. Julius Marx's character from \"Fun In Hi Skule\" was an ethnic German, so Julius played him with a German accent. After the sinking of the in 1915, public anti-German sentiment was widespread, and Marx's German character was booed, so he quickly dropped the accent and developed the fast-talking wise-guy character that became his trademark.\n\nThe Marx Brothers became the biggest comedic stars of the Palace Theatre in New York City, which billed itself as the \"Valhalla of Vaudeville\". Brother Chico's deal-making skills resulted in three hit plays on Broadway. No comedy routine had ever so infected the Broadway circuit.\n\nAll of this predated their Hollywood career. By the time the Marxes made their first movie, they were major stars with sharply honed skills, and when Groucho was relaunched to stardom on \"You Bet Your Life\", he had already been performing successfully for half a century.\n\nGroucho Marx made 26 movies, 13 of them with his brothers Chico and Harpo. Marx developed a routine as a wisecracking hustler with a distinctive chicken-walking lope, an exaggerated greasepaint mustache and eyebrows, and an ever-present cigar, improvising insults to stuffy dowagers (often played by Margaret Dumont) and anyone else who stood in his way. As the Marx Brothers, he and his brothers starred in a series of popular stage shows and movies.\n\nTheir first movie was a silent film made in 1921 that was never released, and is believed to have been destroyed at the time. A decade later, the team made some of their Broadway hits into movies, including \"The Cocoanuts\" and \"Animal Crackers\". Other successful films were \"Monkey Business\", \"Horse Feathers\", \"Duck Soup\", and \"A Night at the Opera\". One quip from Marx concerned his response to Sam Wood, the director of \"A Night at the Opera\". Furious with the Marx Brothers' ad-libs and antics on the set, Wood yelled in disgust: \"You can't make an actor out of clay.\" Groucho responded, \"Nor a director out of Wood.\"\n\nMarx also worked as a radio comedian and show host. One of his earliest stints was a short-lived series in 1932, \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel,\" costarring Chico. Though most of the scripts and discs were thought to have been destroyed, all but one of the scripts were found in 1988 in the Library of Congress.\nIn 1947 Marx was asked to host a radio quiz program \"You Bet Your Life.\" It was broadcast by ABC and then CBS before moving to NBC. It moved from radio to television on October 5, 1950 and ran for eleven years. Filmed before a live audience, the show consisted of Marx bantering with the contestants and ad-libbing jokes before briefly quizzing them. The show was responsible for popularizing the phrases \"Say the secret woid [word] and the duck will come down and give you fifty dollars,\" \"Who's buried in Grant's Tomb?\" and \"What color is the White House?\" (asked to reward a losing contestant a consolation prize).\n\nThroughout his career he introduced a number of memorable songs in films, including \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\" and \"Hello, I Must Be Going\", in \"Animal Crackers\", \"Whatever It Is, I'm Against It\", \"Everyone Says I Love You\" and \"Lydia the Tattooed Lady\". Frank Sinatra, who once quipped that the only thing he could do better than Marx was sing, made a film with Marx and Jane Russell in 1951 entitled \"Double Dynamite\".\n\nIn public and off-camera, Harpo and Chico were hard to recognize, without their wigs and costumes, but it was almost impossible for fans to recognize Groucho without his trademark eyeglasses, fake eyebrows, and mustache.\nThe greasepaint mustache and eyebrows originated spontaneously prior to a vaudeville performance in the early 1920s when he did not have time to apply the pasted-on mustache he had been using (or, according to his autobiography, simply did not enjoy the removal of the mustache every night because of the effects of tearing an adhesive bandage off the same patch of skin every night). After applying the greasepaint mustache, a quick glance in the mirror revealed his natural hair eyebrows were too undertoned and did not match the rest of his face, so Marx added the greasepaint to his eyebrows and headed for the stage. The absurdity of the greasepaint was never discussed on-screen, but in a famous scene in \"Duck Soup,\" where both Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) disguise themselves as Groucho, they are briefly seen applying the greasepaint, implicitly answering any question a viewer might have had about where he got his mustache and eyebrows.\n\nMarx was asked to apply the greasepaint mustache once more for \"You Bet Your Life\" when it came to television, but he refused, opting instead to grow a real one, which he wore for the rest of his life. By this time, his eyesight had weakened enough for him actually to need corrective lenses; before then, his eyeglasses had merely been a stage prop. He debuted this new, and now much-older, appearance in \"Love Happy,\" the Marx Brothers's last film as a comedy team.\n\nHe did paint the old character mustache over his real one on a few rare performing occasions, including a TV sketch with Jackie Gleason on the latter's variety show in the 1960s (in which they performed a variation on the song \"Mister Gallagher and Mister Shean,\" co-written by Marx's uncle Al Shean) and the 1968 Otto Preminger film \"Skidoo\". In his late 70s at the time, Marx remarked on his appearance: \"I looked like I was embalmed.\" He played a mob boss called \"God\" and, according to Marx, \"both my performance and the film were God-awful!\"\n\nThe exaggerated walk, with one hand on the small of his back and his torso bent almost 90 degrees at the waist was a parody of a fad from the 1880s and 1890s. Fashionable young men of the upper classes would affect a walk with their right hand held fast to the base of their spines, and with a slight lean forward at the waist and a very slight twist toward the right with the left shoulder, allowing the left hand to swing free with the gait. (Edmund Morris, in his biography \"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\", describes a young Roosevelt, newly elected to the State Assembly, walking into the House Chamber for the first time in this trendy, affected gait, somewhat to the amusement of the older and more rural members.) Groucho exaggerated this fad to a marked degree, and the comedy effect was enhanced by how out of date the fashion was by the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nGroucho's three marriages all ended in divorce. His first wife was chorus girl Ruth Johnson. He was 29 and she 19 at the time of their wedding. The couple had two children, Arthur Marx and Miriam Marx. His second wife was Kay Marvis (m. 1945â51), Catherine Dittig, former wife of Leo Gorcey. Groucho was 54 and Kay 21 at the time of their marriage. They had a daughter, Melinda Marx. His third wife was actress Eden Hartford. She was 24 when she married the 63-year-old Groucho.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Groucho described his perfect woman: âSomeone who looks like Marilyn Monroe and talks like George S. Kaufman.â\n\nGroucho was denied membership in an informal symphonietta of friends (including Harpo) organized by Ben Hecht, because he could play only the mandolin. When the group began its first rehearsal at Hecht's home, Groucho rushed in and demanded silence from the \"lousy amateurs\". The musicians discovered him conducting the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra in a performance of the overture to \"TannhÃ¤user\" in Hecht's living room. Groucho was allowed to join the symphonietta.\n\nLater in life, Groucho would sometimes note to talk show hosts, not entirely jokingly, that he was unable to actually insult anyone, because the target of his comment would assume that it was a Groucho-esque joke, and would laugh.\n\nDespite his lack of formal education, he wrote many books, including his autobiography, \"Groucho and Me\" (1959) and \"Memoirs of a Mangy Lover\" (1963). He was a friend of such literary figures as Booth Tarkington, T. S. Eliot and Carl Sandburg. Much of his personal correspondence with those and other figures is featured in the book \"The Groucho Letters\" (1967) with an introduction and commentary on the letters written by Groucho, who donated his letters to the Library of Congress.\n\nGroucho made serious efforts to learn to play the guitar. In the 1932 film \"Horse Feathers\", Groucho performs the filmâs love theme âEveryone Says I Love Youâ for costar Thelma Todd on a Gibson L-5.\n\nIrving Berlin quipped, \"The world would not be in such a snarl, had Marx been Groucho instead of Karl\". In his book \"The Groucho Phile\", Marx says \"I've been a liberal Democrat all my life\", and \"I frankly find Democrats a better, more sympathetic crowd... I'll continue to believe that Democrats have a greater regard for the common man than Republicans do\". \"Marx & Lennon: The Parallel Sayings\" was published in 2005; the book records similar sayings between Groucho Marx and John Lennon.\n\nGroucho's radio life was not as successful as his life on stage and in film, though historians such as Gerald Nachman and Michael Barson suggest that, in the case of the single-season \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\" (1932), the failure may have been a combination of a poor time slot and the Marx Brothers' returning to Hollywood to make another film.\n\nIn the mid-1940s, during a depressing lull in his career (his radio show \"Blue Ribbon Town\" had failed, he failed to sell his proposed sitcom \"The Flotsam Family\" only to see it become a huge hit as \"The Life of Riley\" with William Bendix in the title role, and the Marx Brothers as film performers were well past their prime), Groucho was scheduled to appear on a radio show with Bob Hope. Annoyed that he was made to wait in the Green Room for 40 minutes, Groucho went on the air in a foul mood.\n\nHope started by saying \"Why, it's Groucho Marx, ladies and gentlemen! (\"applause\") Groucho, what brings you here from the hot desert?\" Groucho retorted, \"Hot desert my foot, I've been standing in the cold waiting room for forty minutes!\" Groucho continued to ignore the script, and although Hope was a formidable ad-libber in his own right, he could not begin to keep up with Groucho, who lengthened the scene well beyond its allotted time slot with a veritable onslaught of improvised wisecracks.\n\nListening in on the show was producer John Guedel, who had a brainstorm. He approached Groucho about doing a quiz show, to which Groucho derisively retorted, \"A \"quiz show\"? Only actors who are completely washed up resort to a quiz show!\" Undeterred, Guedel explained that the quiz would be only a backdrop for Groucho's interviews of people, and the storm of ad-libbing that they would elicit. Groucho said, \"Well, I've had no success in radio, and I can't hold on to a sponsor. At this point, I'll try anything!\"\n\n\"You Bet Your Life\" debuted in October 1947 on radio on ABC (which aired it from 1947 to 1949), sponsored by costume jewelry manufacturer Allen Gellman; and then on CBS (1949â50), and finally NBC, continuing until May 1961âon radio only, 1947â1950; on both radio and television, 1950â1960; and on television only, 1960â1961. The show proved a huge hit, being one of the most popular on television by the mid-1950s. With George Fenneman as his announcer and straight man, Groucho entertained his audiences with improvised conversation with his guests. Since \"You Bet Your Life\" was mostly ad-libbed and unscriptedâalthough writers did pre-interview the guests and feed Groucho ready-made lines in advanceâthe producers insisted that the network prerecord it (instead of it being broadcast live). There were two reasons for this: prerecording provided Groucho with time to fish around for funny exchanges and any intervening dead spots to be edited out; and secondly to protect the network, since Groucho was a notorious loose cannon and known to say almost anything. The television show ran for 11 successful seasons until it was canceled in 1961. Automobile \"marque\" DeSoto was a longtime major sponsor. For the DeSoto ads Marx would sometimes say: \"Tell 'em Groucho sent you\", or \"Try a DeSoto before you decide\".\n\nThe program's theme music was an instrumental version of \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\", which became increasingly identified as Groucho's personal theme song. A recording of the song with Groucho and the Ken Lane singers with an orchestra directed by Victor Young was released in 1952. Another recording made by Groucho during this period was \"The Funniest Song in the World\", released on the Young People's Records label in 1949. It was a series of five original children's songs with a connecting narrative about a monkey and his fellow zoo creatures.\n\nThe show's most famous remark supposedly occurred as Groucho was interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 19 children. When Marx asked why she had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story is said to have replied, \"I love my husband\"; to which Marx responded, \"I love my cigar, but I take it out of my mouth once in awhile.\" The remark was judged too risquÃ© to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast. Marion and Charlotte Storyâparents of 20 children, not 19âdid in fact appear as contestants on the radio version of the show, in 1950. Audio recordings of the interview exist, and a reference to cigars is made (\"With each new kid, do you go around passing out cigars?\"), but there is no evidence of the famous line. Marx and Fenneman both denied that the incident took place. \"I get credit all the time for things I never said,\" Marx told Roger Ebert, in 1972. \"You know that line in \"You Bet Your Life\"? The guy says he has seventeen kids and I say, 'I smoke a cigar, but I take it out of my mouth occasionally'? I never said that.\" Marx's 1976 memoir recounts the episode as fact, but co-writer Hector Arce relied mostly on sources other than Marx himselfâwho was by then in his mid eighties and mentally compromisedâand was probably unaware that Marx had specifically denied making the legendary observation.\n\nBy the time \"You Bet Your Life\" debuted on TV on October 5, 1950, Groucho had grown a real mustache (which he had already sported earlier in the films \"Copacabana\" and \"Love Happy\").\n\nDuring a tour of Germany in 1958, accompanied by then-wife Eden, daughter Melinda, Robert Dwan and Dwan's daughter Judith, he climbed a pile of rubble that marked the site of Adolf Hitler's bunker, the site of Hitler's death, and performed a two-minute Charleston. He later remarked to Richard J. Anobile in \"The Marx Brothers Scrapbook,\" \"Not much satisfaction after he killed six million Jews!\"\nIn 1960, Groucho, a lifelong devotee of the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, appeared as Koko the Lord High Executioner in a televised production of \"The Mikado\" on NBC's \"Bell Telephone Hour\". A clip of this is in rotation on Classic Arts Showcase.\n\nAnother TV show, \"Tell It To Groucho\", premiered January 11, 1962 on CBS, but only lasted five months. On October 1, 1962, Groucho, after acting as occasional guest host of \"The Tonight Show\" during the six-month interval between Jack Paar and Johnny Carson, introduced Carson as the new host.\n\nIn 1964, Marx starred in the \"Time for Elizabeth\" episode of \"Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre\", a truncated version of a play that Groucho Marx and Norman Krasna wrote in 1948.\n\nIn 1965, Groucho starred in a weekly show for British TV titled \"Groucho\", broadcast on ITV. The program was along similar lines to \"You Bet Your Life\", with Keith Fordyce taking on the Fenneman role. However, it was poorly received and lasted only 11 weeks.\n\nGroucho appeared as a gangster named God in the movie \"Skidoo\" (1968), directed by Otto Preminger, and costarring Jackie Gleason and Carol Channing. It was released by the studio where the Marx Brothers began their film career, Paramount Pictures. The film received almost universally negative reviews. As a side note, writer Paul Krassner published a story in the February 1981 issue of \"High Times\", relating how Groucho prepared for the LSD-themed movie by taking a dose of the drug in Krassner's company, and had a moving, largely pleasant experience.\n\nGroucho developed friendships with rock star Alice Cooperâthe two were photographed together for \"Rolling Stone\" magazineâand television host Dick Cavett, becoming a frequent guest on Cavett's late-night talk show, even appearing in a one-man, 90-minute interview. He befriended Elton John when the British singer was staying in California in 1972, insisting on calling him \"John Elton.\" According to writer Philip Norman, when Groucho jokingly pointed his index fingers as if holding a pair of six-shooters, Elton John put up his hands and said, \"Don't shoot me, I'm only the piano player,\" thereby naming the album he had just completed. A film poster for the Marx Bros. movie \"Go West\" is visible on the album cover photograph as an homage to Groucho. Elton John accompanied Groucho to a performance of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\". As the lights went down, Groucho called out, \"Does it have a happy ending?\" And during the Crucifixion scene, he declared, \"This is sure to offend the Jews.\"\n\nGroucho's previous work regained popularity; new books of transcribed conversations were published by Richard J. Anobile and Charlotte Chandler. In a BBC interview in 1975, Groucho called his greatest achievement having a book selected for cultural preservation in the Library of Congress. In a Cavett interview in 1971, Groucho said being published in The New Yorker under his own name, Julius Henry Marx, meant more than all the plays he appeared in. As a man who never had formal schooling, to have his writings declared culturally important was a point of great satisfaction. As he passed his 81st birthday in 1971, however, Groucho became increasingly frail, physically and mentally, as a result of a succession of minor strokes.\n\nIn 1972, largely at the behest of his companion Erin Fleming, Groucho staged a live one-man show at Carnegie Hall that was later released as a double album, \"An Evening with Groucho\", on A&M Records. He also made an appearance in 1973 on a short-lived variety show hosted by Bill Cosby. Fleming's influence on Marx was controversial. Some close to Marx believed that she did much to revive his popularity, and the relationship with a younger woman boosted his ego and vitality. Others described her as a Svengali, exploiting an increasingly senile Marx in pursuit of her own stardom. Marx's children, particularly Arthur, felt strongly that Fleming was pushing their weak father beyond his physical and mental limits. Writer Mark Evanier concurred.\n\nOn the 1974 Academy Awards telecast, Marx's final major public appearance, Jack Lemmon presented him with an honorary Academy Award to a standing ovation. Noticeably frail, Groucho took a bow for his deceased brothers. \"I wish that Harpo and Chico could be here to share with me this great honor,\" he said. He also praised the late Margaret Dumont as a great straight woman who never understood any of his jokes. Groucho's final appearance was a brief sketch with George Burns in the Bob Hope television special \"Joys\" (a parody of the 1975 movie \"Jaws\") in March 1976. His health continued to decline the following year; he was never told of his brother Gummo's death, at age 84 on April 21, 1977, for fear of eliciting still further deterioration.\n\nGroucho maintained his irrepressible sense of humor to the very end, however. George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story of one of his final visits to Groucho's home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Groucho from his wheelchair, put his arms around his torso, and began to \"walk\" the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: \"Fenneman,\" whispered Groucho, \"you always were a lousy dancer.\" When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, \"Don't be sillyâeverybody has a temperature.\" Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: \"I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you,\" he said. \"And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; and he put his fingers on the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, which brings me to tears.\"\n\nMarx was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with pneumonia on June 22, 1977 and died there nearly two months later at the age of 86 on August 19, four months after Gummo's death.\n\nMarx was cremated and the ashes were interred in the Eden Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Groucho had the longest lifespan of all the Marx Brothers and was survived by his children and younger brother Zeppo, who outlived him by two years. His gravestone bears no epitaph; but in one of his last interviews, he suggested one: \"Excuse me, I can't stand up.\"\n\nProtracted court battles over the disposition of his estate lasted well into the 1980s. Eventually, Arthur Marx was awarded the bulk of the estate's assets, and Fleming was ordered to repay $472,000.\n\nGroucho Marx was, and remains, the most recognizable and well-known of the Marx Brothers. Groucho-like characters and references have appeared in popular culture both during and after his life, some aimed at audiences who may never have seen a Marx Brothers movie. Groucho's trademark eyeglasses, nose, mustache, and cigar have become icons of comedyâglasses with fake noses and mustaches (referred to as \"Groucho glasses\", \"nose-glasses,\" and other names) are sold by novelty and costume shops around the world.\n\nNat Perrin, close friend of Groucho Marx and writer of several Marx Brothers films, inspired John Astin's portrayal of Gomez Addams on the 1960s TV series \"The Addams Family\" with similarly thick mustache, eyebrows, sardonic remarks, backward logic, and ever-present cigar (pulled from his breast pocket already lit).\n\nA meeting with Elton John led to a press photo of Groucho pointing both of his index fingers and thumbs at Elton like revolvers. John's spontaneous response to hold up his hands and replying \"Don't shoot me! I'm only the piano player!\" was so amusing that Elton John reused it as the title of a 1973 album. An added Marx homage was that a poster for the Marx Brothers' movie Go West was included on the cover art.\n\nTwo albums by British rock band Queen, \"A Night at the Opera\" (1975) and \"A Day at the Races\" (1976), are named after Marx Brothers films. In March 1977, Groucho invited Queen to visit him in his Los Angeles home; there they performed \"'39\" a cappella. A long-running ad campaign for Vlasic Pickles features an animated stork that imitates Groucho's mannerisms and voice. On the famous Hollywood Sign in California, one of the \"O\"s is dedicated to Groucho. Alice Cooper contributed over $27,000 to remodel the sign, in memory of his friend.\n\nActor Frank Ferrante has performed as Groucho Marx on stage for more than two decades. He continues to tour under rights granted by the Marx family in a show entitled \"An Evening with Groucho\" in theaters throughout the United States and Canada with supporting actors and piano accompanist Jim Furmston. In the late 1980s Ferrante starred as Groucho in the off-Broadway and London show \"\" penned by Groucho's son Arthur. Ferrante portrayed the comedian from age 15 to 85. The show was later filmed for PBS in 2001. In 1982, Gabe Kaplan filmed a version of the same show, entitled \"Groucho\".\n\nWoody Allen's 1996 musical \"Everyone Says I Love You\", in addition to being named for one of Groucho's signature songs, ends with a Groucho-themed New Year's Eve party in Paris, which some of the stars, including Allen and Goldie Hawn, attend in full Groucho costume. The highlight of the scene is an ensemble song-and-dance performance of \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\"âdone entirely in French.\n\nThe BBC remade the radio sitcom \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\", with contemporary actors playing the parts of the original cast. The series was repeated on digital radio station BBC7. Scottish playwright Louise Oliver wrote a play named \"Waiting for Groucho\" about Chico and Harpo waiting for Groucho to turn up for the filming of their last project together. This was performed by Glasgow theatre company Rhymes with Purple Productions at the Edinburgh Fringe and in Glasgow and Hamilton in 2007â08. Groucho was played by Scottish actor Frodo McDaniel.\n\nSidney Sheldon wrote a roman Ã  clef on Marx and his partner Erin Fleming titled A Stranger in the Mirror, published in 1976. It was made into a television movie in 1993 with actor Perry King playing the role inspired by Marx.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12426", "title": "Groucho Marx"}

It was released in Japan on March 21, 2001, in North America on June 11, 2001, in Australia and Europe on June 22, 2001, and in the People's Republic of China on June 8, 2004 (excluding Hong Kong). Nintendo's competitors in the handheld market at the time were the Neo Geo Pocket Color, WonderSwan, GP32, Tapwave Zodiac, and the N-Gage. Despite the competitors' best efforts, Nintendo maintained a majority market share with the Game Boy Advance.\nAs of June 30, 2010, the Game Boy Advance series has sold 81.51 million units worldwide. Its successor, the Nintendo DS, was released in November 2004 and is also compatible with Game Boy Advance software.\n\nContrary to the previous Game Boy models, which were all following the \"portrait\" form factor of the original Game Boy (designed by Gunpei Yokoi), the Game Boy Advance was designed in a \"landscape\" form factor, putting the buttons to the sides of the device instead of below the screen. The Game Boy Advance was designed by the French designer GwÃ©naÃ«l Nicolas and his Tokyo-based design studio Curiosity Inc.\n\nIn 1996, magazines including \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", issues 53 and 54 of \"Total!\" and the July 1996 issue of \"Game Informer\" featured reports of a new Game Boy, codenamed Project Atlantis. Although the expected release date of \"early 1997\" would make that machine seem to be the Game Boy Color, it was described as having a 32-bit RISC processor, a 3-by-2-inch color LCD screen, and a link portâa description that more closely matches the Game Boy Advance. It also may have referred to the unnamed, unreleased Game Boy Color successor prototype that was revealed at 2009's Game Developers Conference. It was announced that Nintendo Co., Ltd. (NCL) was working on a game for the system called \"Mario's Castle\".\n\nThe technical specifications of the original Game Boy Advance are, as provided by Nintendo:\nBackward compatibility for Game Boy and Game Boy Color games is provided by a custom 4.194/8.388Â MHz Z80-based coprocessor (Game Boy Advance software can use the audio tone generators to supplement the primary sound system), while a link port at the top of the unit allows it to be connected to other devices using a Nintendo Game Link cable or GameCube link cable. When playing Game Boy or Game Boy Color games on the Game Boy Advance, the L and R buttons can be used to toggle between a stretched widescreen format and the original screen ratio of the Game Boy . Game Boy games can be played using the same selectable color palettes as on the Game Boy Color.\nEvery Nintendo handheld system following the release of the Game Boy Advance SP has included a built-in light and rechargeable battery.\n\nThe Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS 2D graphics hardware have scaling and rotation for traditional tiled backgrounds in its modes 1 and 2 and scaling and rotation for bitmaps in modes 3 through 5 (used less often on the GBA because of technical limitations). On each machine supporting this effect, it is possible to change the scaling and rotation values during the horizontal blanking period of each scanline to draw a flat plane in a perspective projection. More complex effects such as fuzz are possible by using other equations for the position, scaling, and rotation of each line. The \"character mode\" supports up to 4 tile map background layers per frame, with each tile being 8x8 pixels in size and having 16 or 256 colors. The \"character mode\" also supports up to 128 hardware sprites per frame, with any sprite size from 8x8 to 64x64 pixels and with 16 or 256 colors per sprite.\n\nWith hardware comparable to the Super NES, the Game Boy Advance represents progress for sprite-based technology. The Game Boy Advance has platformers, SNES-style role-playing video games, and classic games ported from various 8-bit and 16-bit systems of the previous generations. This includes the \"Super Mario Advance\" series, as well as the system's backward compatibility with all earlier Game Boy titles.\n\n\"Final Fantasy VI Advance\" was the final licensed Japanese GBA game release. Released November 2006, it was the final Nintendo-published game for the system. \"\" was the final European GBA game, released November 2007. \"Samurai Deeper Kyo\" was the final North American GBA game, released in February 2008.\n\nAn accessory for the Nintendo GameCube, known as the Game Boy Player, was released in 2003 as the successor to the Super Game Boy peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The accessory allows Game Boy Advance games, as well as Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, to be played on the GameCube. However, some games may have compatibility issues due to certain features (for example, games with built-in motion sensors would require players to manipulate the console itself).\n\nGame Boy Advance games are compatible with the Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS Lite handheld consoles, which feature a cartridge slot at the bottom. They are not, however, compatible with the Nintendo DSi, as it does not feature a cartridge slot.\n\nAs part of an Ambassador Program for early adopters of the Nintendo 3DS system, ten Game Boy Advance games were made available for free for players who bought a system before August 2011. Unlike other Virtual Console games for the system, players were not able to use features such as the Home menu or save states. A full Virtual Console service for Game Boy Advance games was launched for the Wii U console.\n\nNintendo released many addons for the Game Boy Advance. These include:\n\nOther accessories for the Game Boy Advance are:\n\nIn early 2003, Nintendo introduced a new form-factor for the handheld, known as the Game Boy Advance SP (model AGS-001). The redesigned unit resembles a pocket-size laptop computer, including a folding case approximately one-half the size of the original unit. It also supports a rechargeable lithium ion battery, a significantly brighter LCD screen, and an internal front-light that can be toggled on and off. The redesign was intended to address some common complaints about the original Game Boy Advance, which had been criticized for being somewhat uncomfortable to use, especially due to an overly dark screen.\n\nAround the same time as the release of the Game Boy Micro, Nintendo released a new backlit version of the SP (model AGS-101) in North America (commonly referred to as the \"GBA SP+\", SPII, or SP2). The switch that controls the light now toggles between \"normal\" (which itself is already brighter than the original Game Boy Advance SP's screen), and \"bright\", an intense brightness level similar to an LCD television set.\n\nIn September 2005, Nintendo released a second redesign of the Game Boy Advance. This model, dubbed the Game Boy Micro, is similar in style to the original Game Boy Advance's horizontal orientation, but is much smaller and sleeker. The Game Boy Micro also allows the user to switch between several colored faceplates to allow customization, a feature which Nintendo advertised heavily around the Game Boy Micro's launch. Nintendo also hoped that this \"fashion\" feature would help target audiences outside of typical video game players. Unlike the previous Game Boy Advance models, Game Boy Micro is unable to support Game Boy and Game Boy Color titles. The Game Boy Micro did not make much of an impact in the video game market as it was overshadowed by Nintendo's other portable, the Nintendo DS.\n\nThe Game Boy Advance, SP, and Micro had numerous colors and limited editions.\n\nThe Game Boy Advance was initially available in Arctic, Black, Orange, Fuchsia, Glacier (translucent blue/purple) and Indigo. Later in the system's availability, additional colours and special editions were released. These editions include: Red, Clear Orange/Black, Platinum, White, Gold, Hello Kitty edition (pink with Hello Kitty and logo on bezel), King of Fighters edition (black with images on bezel and buttons), Chobits edition (translucent light blue, with images on bezel and buttons), Battle Network Rockman EXE 2 (light blue with images on bezel), Mario Bros. edition (Glacier with Mario and Luigi on bezel) and Yumiuri Giant edition (Glacier with images on bezel).\n\nA number of PokÃ©mon-themed limited-edition systems were made available in PokÃ©mon Center stores in Japan. These editions include: Gold PokÃ©mon edition (Gold with Pikachu and Pichu on bezel), Suicune edition (blue/grey with greyscale Pikachu and Pichu on bezel, and a PokÃ©mon Center sticker on the back), Celebi edition (olive green with Celebi images on bezel), and Latias/Latios edition (pink/red and purple, with images of Latias and Latios on bezel).\n\n\nOn December 1, 2006, Nintendo of America released launch-to-date information indicating that the company had sold 33.6 million units of the Game Boy Advance series in the United States. In a Kotaku article published on January 18, 2008, Nintendo revealed that the Game Boy Advance series has sold 36.2 million units in the United States, as of January 1, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the Game Boy Advance series has sold 81.51 million units worldwide, of which 43.57 million are Game Boy Advance SP units and 2.42 million are Game Boy Micro units.\n\nAfter the Game Boy Advance's support lessened, the most popular software became mostly games oriented to younger gamers.\n\nNintendo did not initially release GBA games for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console, but later made ten titles available to the platform as part of the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program. Satoru Iwata stated Game Boy Advance games will be available on the Wii U Virtual Console sometime during April 2014. On April 3, 2014, the first of the announced GBA games (\"Advance Wars\", \"Metroid Fusion\" and \"\") were released for the Wii U Virtual Console.\n\n", "id": "12430", "title": "Game Boy Advance"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12431", "text": "Google Search\n\nGoogle Search, commonly referred to as Google Web Search or simply Google, is a web search engine developed by Google. It is the most-used search engine on the World Wide Web, handling more than three billion searches each day. it is the most used search engine in the US with 64.0% market share.\n\nThe order of search on Google's search-results pages is based, in part, on a priority rank called a \"PageRank\". Google Search provides many different options for customized search, using Boolean operators such as exclusion (\"-xx\"), alternatives (\"xx OR yy OR zz\"), and wildcards (\"Winston * Churchill\" returns \"Winston Churchill\", \"Winston Spencer Churchill\", etc.). The same and other options can be specified in a different way on an Advanced Search page.\n\nThe main purpose of Google Search is to hunt for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers, as opposed to other data, such as images or data contained in databases. It was originally developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1997. Google Search provides several features beyond searching for words. These include synonyms, weather forecasts, time zones, stock quotes, maps, earthquake data, movie showtimes, airports, home listings, and sports scores. There are special features for numbers, dates, and some specific forms, including ranges, prices, temperatures, money and measurement unit conversions, calculations, package tracking, patents, area codes, and language translation. In June 2011 Google introduced \"Google Voice Search\" to search for spoken, rather than typed, words. In May 2012 Google introduced a Knowledge Graph semantic search feature in the U.S.\n\nAnalysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic, social and health trends. Data about the frequency of use of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels, and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys. As of mid-2016, Googleâs search engine has begun to rely on these deep neural networks.\n\nIn October 2016, Gary Illyes, a webmaster trends analyst with Google, announced that the search engine will be making a new, primary web index dedicated for mobile, with a secondary, less up-to-date index for desktop use. The change is a response from the continued growth in mobile, and a push for web developers to adopt a mobile-friendly version of their websites. Illyes stated the change will happen in \"months\".\n\nCompetitors of Google include Baidu and Soso.com in China; Naver.com and Daum.net in South Korea; Yandex in Russia; Seznam.cz in the Czech Republic; Yahoo in Japan, Taiwan and the US, as well as Bing and DuckDuckGo. Some smaller search engines offer facilities not available with Google, e.g. not storing any private or tracking information; one such search engine is Ixquick.\n\nGoogle's rise to success was largely due to a patented algorithm called PageRank that helps rank web pages that match a given search string. When Google was a Stanford research project, it was nicknamed BackRub because the technology checks backlinks to determine a site's importance. Previous keyword-based methods of ranking search results, used by many search engines that were once more popular than Google, would rank pages by how often the search terms occurred in the page, or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page. The PageRank algorithm instead analyzes human-generated links assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are themselves likely to be important. The algorithm computes a recursive score for pages, based on the weighted sum of the PageRanks of the pages linking to them. PageRank is thought to correlate well with human concepts of importance. In addition to PageRank, Google, over the years, has added many other secret criteria for determining the ranking of pages on result lists, reported to be over 250 different indicators, the specifics of which are kept secret to keep spammers at bay and help Google maintain an edge over its competitors globally.\n\nIn a potential hint of Google's future direction for their Search algorithm, Eric Schmidt, Google's then chief executive, said in a 2007 interview with the \"Financial Times\": \"The goal is to enable Google users to be able to ask the question such as 'What shall I do tomorrow?' and 'What job shall I take?'\". Schmidt reaffirmed this during a 2010 interview with the Wall Street Journal: \"I actually think most people don't want Google to answer their questions, they want Google to tell them what they should be doing next.\"\n\nIn 2013 the European Commission found that Google Search favored Google's own products, instead of offering consumers the best result for their needs. In February 2015 Google announced a major change to its mobile search algorithm which would favor mobile friendly over other websites. Nearly 60% of Google's online search traffic comes from mobile phones. Google says it wants its users to have access to premium quality websites. Those websites which lack a mobile friendly interface would be demoted and it is expected that this update will cause a shake-up of ranks. Businesses who fail to update their websites accordingly could see a dip in their regular websites traffic.\n\nThe exact percentage of the total of web pages that Google indexes is not known, as it is very difficult to accurately calculate. Google presents a two-line summary and also a preview of each search result, which includes a link to a cached (stored), usually older version of the page.\n\nGoogle's cache link in its search results provides a way of retrieving information from websites that have recently gone down and a way of retrieving data more quickly than by clicking the direct link. This feature is still available, but many users are not aware of this because it has been moved to the previews of the search results presented next to these.\n\nGoogle not only indexes and caches web pages, but also takes \"snapshots\" of other file types, which include PDF, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, Flash SWF, plain text files, and so on. Except in the case of text and SWF files, the cached version is a conversion to (X)HTML, allowing those without the corresponding viewer application to read the file. Users can customize the search engine, by setting a default language, using the \"SafeSearch\" filtering technology and set the number of results shown on each page. Google has been criticized for placing long-term cookies on users' machines to store these preferences, a tactic which also enables them to track a user's search terms and retain the data for more than a year. For any query, up to the first 1000 results can be shown with a maximum of 100 displayed per page. The ability to specify the number of results is available only if \"Instant Search\" is not enabled. If \"Instant Search\" is enabled, only 10 results are displayed, regardless of this setting.\n\nIn 2012, Google changed its rankings to demote sites that had been accused of piracy, except the Google-owned YouTube site.\n\nDespite its immense index, there is also a considerable amount of data available in online databases which are accessible by means of queries but not by links. This so-called invisible or deep Web is minimally covered by Google and other search engines. The deep Web contains library catalogs, official legislative documents of governments, phone books, and other content which is dynamically prepared to respond to a query.\n\nBecause Google is the most popular search engine, many webmasters have become eager to influence their website's Google rankings. An industry of consultants has arisen to help websites increase their rankings on Google and on other search engines. This field, called search engine optimization, attempts to discern patterns in search engine listings, and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more searchers to their client's sites. Search engine optimization encompasses both \"on page\" factors (like body copy, title elements, H1 heading elements and image alt attribute values) and Off Page Optimization factors (like anchor text and PageRank). The general idea is to affect Google's relevance algorithm by incorporating the keywords being targeted in various places \"on page\", in particular the title element and the body copy (note: the higher up in the page, presumably the better its keyword prominence and thus the ranking). Too many occurrences of the keyword, however, cause the page to look suspect to Google's spam checking algorithms. Google has published guidelines for website owners who would like to raise their rankings when using legitimate optimization consultants. It has been hypothesized, and, allegedly, is the opinion of the owner of one business about which there have been numerous complaints, that negative publicity, for example, numerous consumer complaints, may serve as well to elevate page rank on Google Search as favorable comments. The particular problem addressed in \"The New York Times\" article, which involved DecorMyEyes, was addressed shortly thereafter by an undisclosed fix in the Google algorithm. According to Google, it was not the frequently published consumer complaints about DecorMyEyes which resulted in the high ranking but mentions on news websites of events which affected the firm such as legal actions against it. Google Search Console helps to check for websites that use duplicate or copyright content.\n\nUniversal search was launched by Google on May 16, 2007. It was an idea which merged the results from different searches into one. Prior to Universal search, a standard Google search would consist of links to different websites. Universal search incorporates a wide variety of information such as websites, news, pictures, maps, blogs, videos, and more to display as search results. Marissa Mayer, VP of Search Products & User Experience during Universal search launch, described the goal of universal search, \"With Universal search, we're attempting to break down the walls that traditionally separated our various search properties and integrate the vast amounts of information available into one simple set of search resultsâ¦ We want to help you find the very best answer, even if you don't know where to look.\"\n\nIn October 2016, Gary Illyes, a webmaster trends analyst with Google, announced that the search engine will be making a new, primary web index dedicated for mobile, with a secondary, less up-to-date index for desktop use. The change is a response from the continued growth in mobile, and a push for web developers to adopt a mobile-friendly version of their websites. Illyes stated the change will happen in \"months\".\n\nGoogle search consists of a series of localized websites. The largest of those, the google.com site, is the top most-visited website in the world. Some of its features include a definition link for most searches including dictionary words, the number of results you got on your search, links to other searches (e.g. for words that Google believes to be misspelled, it provides a link to the search results using its proposed spelling), and many more.\n\nGoogle's search engine normally accepts queries as a simple text, and breaks up the user's text into a sequence of search terms, which will usually be words that are to occur in the results, but one can also use Boolean operators, such as quotations marks (\") for a phrase, a prefix such as \"+\", \"-\" for qualified terms (no longer valid, the '+' was removed from Google on October 19, 2011), or one of several advanced operators, such as \"site:\". The webpages of \"Google Search Basics\" describe each of these additional queries and options (\"see below:\" Search options). Google's Advanced Search web form gives several additional fields which may be used to qualify searches by such criteria as date of first retrieval.\n\nGoogle applies query expansion to the submitted search query, transforming it into the query that will actually be used to retrieve results. As with page ranking, the exact details of the algorithm Google uses are deliberately obscure, but certainly the following transformations are among those that occur:\n\n\nGoogle's homepage includes a button labeled \"I'm Feeling Lucky\". Prior to a change in 2012, when a user typed in a search and clicked on the button the user would be taken directly to the first search result, bypassing the search engine results page. The idea was that if a user is \"feeling lucky\", the search engine would return the perfect match the first time without having to page through the search results. According to a study by Tom Chavez of \"Rapt\", this feature cost Google $110 million a year as 1% of all searches use this feature and bypass all advertising.\n\nWith the introduction of Google Instant, the functionality of the button behaves differently. Currently, the \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" button changes based on the user's settings and what webpage users are at. If Google Instant is turned off, the button will work as it previously did or, if the search box is empty, redirect to the Google Doodles gallery. If Google Instant is turned on and a user hovers over the button, the button text will spin and land on a phrase that starts with \"I'm feeling\" (e.g. \"I'm feeling hungry\" or \"I'm feeling smart\"). Each phrase links to a Google page related to the associated phrase.\n\nGoogle Chrome and Mozilla Firefox used \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" as the default search string when the user entered a query in the location bar; this functionality was deprecated in later versions.\n\nOn May 12, 2009, Google announced that they would be parsing the hCard, hReview, and hProduct microformats and using them to populate search result pages with what they called \"Rich Snippets\".\n\nOn May 17, 2016, Google announce a new search result format builder called \"Rich Card\". Rich cards are similar like Rich snippet, use schema.org Structured markup to showcase the content in a new visual format. Rich card for four content categories: Recipes, Events, Product and Reviews.\n\nBesides the main search-engine feature of searching for text, Google Search has more than 22 \"special features\" (activated by entering any of dozens of \"trigger words\") when searching:\n\nThe webpages maintained by the Google Help Center have text describing more than 15 various search options.\nThe Google operator\n\nSome of the query options are as follows:\n\n\nThe page-display options (or query types) are:\n\nSome searches will give a 403 Forbidden error with the text\nsometimes followed by a CAPTCHA prompt.\n\nThe screen was first reported in 2005, and was a response to the heavy use of Google by search engine optimization companies to check on ranks of sites they were optimizing. Google says the message is triggered only by high volumes of requests from a single IP address, however the use of the \"allintext\" operator a few times in a period of minutes has the same effect. Google apparently uses the Google cookie as part of its determination of refusing service.\n\nIn June 2009, after the death of pop superstar Michael Jackson, this message appeared to many internet users who were searching Google for news stories related to the singer, and was assumed by Google to be a DDoS attack, although many queries were submitted by legitimate searchers.\n\nGoogle flags search results with the message \"This site may harm your computer\" if the site is known to install malicious software in the background or otherwise surreptitiously. Google does this to protect users against visiting sites that could harm their computers. For approximately 40 minutes on January 31, 2009, all search results were mistakenly classified as malware and could therefore not be clicked; instead a warning message was displayed and the user was required to enter the requested URL manually. The bug was caused by human error.Â The URL of \"/\" (which expands to all URLs) was mistakenly added to the malware patterns file.\n\nOn certain occasions, the logo on Google's webpage will change to a special version, known as a \"Google Doodle\". This is a picture, drawing, or animation that includes the logo. It is usually done for a special event or day although not all of them are well known. Clicking on the Doodle links to a string of Google search results about the topic. The first was a reference to the Burning Man Festival in 1998, and others have been produced for the birthdays of notable people like Albert Einstein, historical events like the interlocking Lego block's 50th anniversary and holidays like Valentine's Day. Some Google Doodles have interactivity beyond a simple search, such as the famous \"Google Pacman\" version that appeared on May 21, 2010.\n\nIn August 2009, Google announced the rollout of a new search architecture, codenamed \"Caffeine\".\nThe new architecture was designed to return results faster and to better deal with rapidly updated information from services including Facebook and Twitter.\nGoogle developers noted that most users would notice little immediate change, but invited developers to test the new search in its sandbox.\nDifferences noted for their impact upon search engine optimization included heavier keyword weighting and the importance of the domain's age.\nThe move was interpreted in some quarters as a response to Microsoft's recent release of an upgraded version of its own search service, renamed Bing.\nGoogle announced completion of Caffeine on June 8, 2010, claiming 50% fresher results due to continuous updating of its index.\nWith Caffeine, Google moved its back-end indexing system away from MapReduce and onto BigTable, the company's distributed database platform. Caffeine is also based on Colossus, or GFS2, an overhaul of the GFS distributed file system.\n\nDuring the Google I/O conference in May 2013, Google's Amit Singhal presented on the future of search, explaining that a search engine's three primary functions will need to evolve and that search will need to answer, converse, and anticipate. As part of his keynote talk, Singhal stated, \"A computer you can talk to? And it will answer everything you ask it? Little did I know, I would grow up to become the person responsible for building my dream for the entire world.\" Conversational search technology was then featured and Singhal introduced the term \"hot-wording\" to describe search without the need for an interface, whereby the user simply prompts the Google search engine by stating, \"OK Google.\" The I/O audience was then shown a demonstration in which a user asked a question and the search engine answered back in \"conversation,\" in addition to the presentation of results for the query.\n\nThe conversational search function was incorporated into the latest version of the Chrome browser during the week beginning May 20, 2013. The \"OK Google\" search prompt was not included into the upgrade and users are required to click on a microphone icon that appears on the right-hand side of the search box. Google displays its answer to the user's question in the form of \"cards\" at the top of the search results while the information is conveyed verballyâaccording to one search engine writer, Google continues to work through the feature's bugs.\n\nThe \"Hummingbird\" update was announced as part of Google's 15-year anniversary and a \"Guardian\" technology journalist described it as \"the biggest change to the inner workings of the world's most popular search engine since Google's \"Caffeine\" update in 2010.\" The update was progressively introduced over the month prior to the announcement and will benefit more modern forms of search, whereby users ask Google a question rather than entering keywords into the search box.\n\nSearches made by search engines, including Google, leave traces. This raises concerns about privacy. In principle, if details of a user's searches are found, those with access to the informationâprincipally state agencies responsible for law enforcement and similar mattersâcan make deductions about the user's activities. This has been used for the detection and prosecution of lawbreakers; for example a murderer was found and convicted after searching for terms such as \"tips with killing with a baseball bat\".\n\nA search may leave traces both on a computer used to make the search, and in records kept by the search provider. When using a search engine through a browser program on a computer, search terms and other information may be stored on the computer by default, unless the browser is set not to do this, or they are erased. Saved terms may be discovered on forensic analysis of the computer. An Internet Service Provider (ISP) or search engine provider (e.g., Google) may store records which relate search terms to an IP address and a time. Whether such logs are kept, and access to them by law enforcement agencies, is subject to legislation in different jurisdictions and working practices; the law may mandate, prohibit, or say nothing about logging of various types of information. Some search engines, located in jurisdictions where it is not illegal, make a feature of not storing user search information.\n\nVarious search engines provide encrypted Web search facilities. In May 2010 Google rolled out SSL-encrypted web search. The encrypted search can be accessed at codice_21\n\nIn 2012 the US Federal Trade Commission fined Google US$22.5 million for violating their agreement not to violate the privacy of users of the Apple Safari (web browser). The FTC was also continuing to investigate if Google's favoring of their own services in their search results violated antitrust regulations.\n\nIn 2008, Google started to give autocompleted search suggestions in a list below the search bar for incompletely entered queries.\n\nSuggestions have increasingly sparked controversies about their bias.\n\nGoogle Instant, a feature that displays suggested results while the user types, was introduced in the US on September 8, 2010. In concert with the Google Instant launch, Google disabled the ability of users to choose to see more than 10 search results per page. At the time of the announcement, Google expected Instant to save users 2 to 5 seconds in every search, collectively about 11 million seconds per hour. Search engine marketing experts speculated that Google Instant would have a great impact on local and paid search. Google Search is a turn from a static HTML page into an AJAX application.\n\nInstant Search can be disabled via Google's \"preferences\" menu, but autocomplete-style search suggestions cannot be disabled, by intention.\n\nThe publication \"\" compiled a list of words that Google Instant did not show. Most banned terms are those considered rude, but some apparently irrelevant searches including \"Myleak\" are removed.\n\nIn September 2012 several sources reported that Google had removed bisexual from the list of blacklisted terms for Instant Search. the word bisexual still did not autocomplete, and LGBT activists renewed efforts to have it whitelisted. \"bisexuality\" (but not \"bisexual\") and \"myleak\" were found.\n\nIn late June 2011, Google introduced a new look to the Google home page in order to boost the use of the Google+ social tools.\n\nOne of the major changes was replacing the classic navigation bar with a black one. Google's digital creative director Chris Wiggins explains: \"We're working on a project to bring you a new and improved Google experience, and over the next few months, you'll continue to see more updates to our look and feel.\" The new navigation bar has been negatively received by a vocal minority.\n\nIn November 2013, Google started testing yellow labels for advertisements displayed in search results, to improve user experience. The new labels, highlighted in yellow color, and aligned to the left of each sponsored link help users clearly differentiate between organic and sponsored results.\n\nA Google Search mobile app is available for Android, Windows Phone and iOS devices. In addition to allowing users to perform web searches, the app implements Google Now, Google's voice recognition and intelligent personal assistant software. Google Now uses a natural language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of web services. Along with answering user-initiated queries, Google Now passively delivers information to the user that it predicts they will want, based on their search habits. Google Search for Android was originally introduced in 2007, the same year the Android operating system was introduced. On January 11, 2012, Google introduced an update where they included an updated and simplified user interface, along with other improvements.\nAs of May 2016, around 20% of Google searches on Android used voice recognition.\n\nGoogle is available in many languages and has been localized completely or partly for many countries.\n\nThe interface has also been made available in some languages for humorous purpose:\n\n\nIn addition to the main URL Google.com, Google Inc. owns 160 domain names for each of the countries/regions in which it has been localized.\n\nOn September 29, 2015, an Ex-Googler Sanmay Ved managed to buy the domain Google.com from Google via Google Domains, and gain full webmaster control. Google later acknowledged the purchase, and rewarded Ved who in turn requested that the reward be donated to charity. As a result, Google doubled the reward.\n\nIn addition to its tool for searching webpages, Google also provides services for searching images, Usenet newsgroups, news websites, videos, searching by locality, maps, and items for sale online. In 2012, Google has indexed over 30 trillion web pages, and received 100 billion queries per month. It also caches much of the content that it indexes. Google operates other tools and services including Google News, Google Shopping, Google Maps, Google Custom Search, Google Earth, Google Docs, Picasa, Panoramio, YouTube, Google Translate, Google Blog Search and Google Desktop Search.\n\nThere are also products available from Google that are not directly search-related. Gmail, for example, is a webmail application, but still includes search features; Google Browser Sync does not offer any search facilities, although it aims to organize your browsing time.\n\nAlso Google starts many new beta products, like Google Social Search or Google Image Swirl.\n\nGoogle claims that a search query requires altogether about 1 kJ or 0.0003 kWÂ·h, which is enough to raise the temperature of one liter of water by 0.24Â Â°C.\n\nIn 2007, a group of Austrian researchers observed a tendency to misuse the Google engine as a \"reality interface\". Ordinary users as well as journalists tend to rely on the first pages of Google search, assuming that everything not listed there is either not important or merely does not exist. The researchers say that \"Google has become the main interface for our whole reality. To be precise: with the Google interface the user gets the impression that the search results imply a kind of totality. In fact, one only sees a small part of what one could see if one also integrates other research tools\".\n\nAt the 2016 New Hampshire primary, the top-searched Democratic candidate was Bernie Sanders with 72% of the searches and won with 60% of the vote, according to real-time results of Google's trending search queries, and Hillary Clinton received 28% of the queries and 38% of the vote. The top-searched Republican candidate was Donald Trump, who received 41% of the searches an hour before the polls closed and won with 35% of the vote and John Kasich got 16% of both the vote and the searches.\n\n\n", "id": "12431", "title": "Google Search"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12432", "text": "Genius\n\nA genius is a person who displays exceptional intellectual ability, creative productivity, universality in genres or originality, typically to a degree that is associated with the achievement of new advances in a domain of knowledge. Despite the presence of scholars in many subjects throughout history, many geniuses have shown high achievements in only a single kind of activity. There is no scientifically precise definition of genius, and the question of whether the notion itself has any real meaning has long been a subject of debate, although psychologists are converging on a definition that emphasizes creativity and eminent achievement. Usually genius is associated with talent, but many authors (for example Cesare Lombroso) systematically distinguish these terms.\n\nIn ancient Rome, the \"genius\" (plural in Latin \"genii\") was the guiding spirit or tutelary deity of a person, family \"(gens)\", or place \"(genius loci)\". The noun is related to the Latin verb \"genui, genitus\", \"to bring into being, create, produce\", as well as to the Greek word for birth. Because the achievements of exceptional individuals seemed to indicate the presence of a particularly powerful \"genius\", by the time of Augustus, the word began to acquire its secondary meaning of \"inspiration, talent\". The term \"genius\" acquired its modern sense in the eighteenth century, and is a conflation of two Latin terms: \"genius\", as above, and \"ingenium\", a related noun referring to our innate dispositions, talents, and inborn nature. Beginning to blend the concepts of the divine and the talented, the \"EncyclopÃ©die\" article on genius (gÃ©nie) describes such a person as \"he whose soul is more expansive and struck by the feelings of all others; interested by all that is in nature never to receive an idea unless it evokes a feeling; everything excites him and on which nothing is lost.\"\n\nThe assessment of intelligence was initiated by Francis Galton (1822â1911) and James McKeen Cattell. They had advocated the analysis of reaction time and sensory acuity as measures of \"neurophysiological efficiency\" and the analysis of sensory acuity as a measure of intelligence.\n\nGalton is regarded as the founder of psychometry. He studied the work of his older half-cousin Charles Darwin about biological evolution. Hypothesizing that eminence is inherited from ancestors, Galton did a study of families of eminent people in Britain, publishing it in 1869 as \"Hereditary Genius\". Galton's ideas were elaborated from the work of two early 19th-century pioneers in statistics: Carl Friedrich Gauss and Adolphe Quetelet. Gauss discovered the normal distribution (bell-shaped curve): given a large number of measurements of the same variable under the same conditions, they vary at random from a most frequent value, the \"average\", to two least frequent values at maximum differences greater and lower than the most frequent value. Quetelet discovered that the bell-shaped curve applied to social statistics gathered by the French government in the course of its normal processes on large numbers of people passing through the courts and the military. His initial work in criminology led him to observe \"the greater the number of individuals observed the more do peculiarities become effaced...\". This ideal from which the peculiarities were effaced became \"the average man\".\n\nGalton was inspired by Quetelet to define the average man as \"an entire normal scheme\"; that is, if one combines the normal curves of every measurable human characteristic, one will in theory perceive a syndrome straddled by \"the average man\" and flanked by persons that are different. In contrast to Quetelet, Galton's average man was not statistical, but was theoretical only. There was no measure of general averageness, only a large number of very specific averages. Setting out to discover a general measure of the average, Galton looked at educational statistics and found bell-curves in test results of all sorts; initially in mathematics grades for the final honors examination and in entrance examination scores for Sandhurst.\n\nGalton's method in \"Hereditary Genius\" was to count and assess the eminent relatives of eminent men. He found that the number of eminent relatives was greater with closer degree of kinship. This work is considered the first example of historiometry, an analytical study of historical human progress. The work is controversial and has been criticised for several reasons. Galton then departed from Gauss in a way that became crucial to the history of the 20th century AD. The bell-shaped curve was not random, he concluded. The differences between the average and the upper end were due to a non-random factor, \"natural ability\", which he defined as \"those qualities of intellect and disposition, which urge and qualify men to perform acts that lead to reputationâ¦a nature which, when left to itself, will, urged by an inherent stimulus, climb the path that leads to eminence.\" The apparent randomness of the scores was due to the randomness of this natural ability in the population as a whole, in theory.\n\nCriticisms include that Galton's study fails to account for the impact of social status and the associated availability of resources in the form of economic inheritance, meaning that inherited \"eminence\" or \"genius\" can be gained through the enriched environment provided by wealthy families. Galton went on to develop the field of eugenics.\n\nGenius is expressed in a variety of forms (e.g., mathematical, literary, musical performance). Persons with genius tend to have strong intuitions about their domains, and they build on these insights with tremendous energy. Carl Rogers, a founder of the Humanistic Approach to Psychology, expands on the idea of a genius trusting his or her intuition in a given field, writing: \"El Greco, for example, must have realized as he looked at some of his early work, that 'good artists do not paint like that.' But somehow he trusted his own experiencing of life, the process of himself, sufficiently that he could go on expressing his own unique perceptions. It was as though he could say, 'Good artists don't paint like this, but \"I\" paint like this.' Or to move to another field, Ernest Hemingway was surely aware that 'good writers do not write like this.' But fortunately he moved toward being Hemingway, being himself, rather than toward someone else's conception of a good writer.\"\n\nA number of people commonly regarded as geniuses have been diagnosed with mental disorders, for example Vincent van Gogh, Virginia Woolf, John Forbes Nash Jr., and Ernest Hemingway.\n\nIt has been suggested that there exists a connection between mental illness, in particular schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and genius. Individuals with bipolar disorder and schizotypal personality disorder, the latter of which being more common amongst relatives of schizophrenics, tend to show elevated creativity.\n\nGalton was a pioneer in investigating both eminent human achievement and mental testing. In his book \"Hereditary Genius\", written before the development of IQ testing, he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong, and that eminence is rare in the general population. Lewis Terman chose \"'near' genius or genius\" as the classification label for the highest classification on his 1916 version of the Stanford-Binet test. By 1926, Terman began publishing about a longitudinal study of California schoolchildren who were referred for IQ testing by their schoolteachers, called Genetic Studies of Genius, which he conducted for the rest of his life. Catherine M. Cox, a colleague of Terman's, wrote a whole book, \"The Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses\", published as volume 2 of The Genetic Studies of Genius book series, in which she analyzed biographical data about historic geniuses. Although her estimates of childhood IQ scores of historical figures who never took IQ tests have been criticized on methodological grounds, Cox's study was thorough in finding out what else matters besides IQ in becoming a genius. By the 1937 second revision of the Stanford-Binet test, Terman no longer used the term \"genius\" as an IQ classification, nor has any subsequent IQ test. In 1939, David Wechsler specifically commented that \"we are rather hesitant about calling a person a genius on the basis of a single intelligence test score\".\n\nThe Terman longitudinal study in California eventually provided historical evidence regarding how genius is related to IQ scores. Many California pupils were recommended for the study by schoolteachers. Two pupils who were tested but rejected for inclusion in the study (because their IQ scores were too low) grew up to be Nobel Prize winners in physics, William Shockley, and Luis Walter Alvarez. Based on the historical findings of the Terman study and on biographical examples such as Richard Feynman, who had an IQ of 125 and went on to win the Nobel Prize in physics and become widely known as a genius, the current view of psychologists and other scholars of genius is that a minimum level of IQ (approximately 125) is necessary for genius but not sufficient, and must be combined with personality characteristics such as drive and persistence, plus the necessary opportunities for talent development.\n\nVarious philosophers have proposed definitions of what genius is and what that implies in the context of their philosophical theories.\nIn the philosophy of David Hume, the way society perceives genius is similar to the way society perceives the ignorant. Hume states that a person with the characteristics of a genius is looked at as a person disconnected from society, as well as a person who works remotely, at a distance, away from the rest of the world. On the other hand, the mere ignorant is still more despised; nor is any thing deemed a surer sign of an illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish, than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble entertainments. The most perfect character is supposed to lie between those extremes; retaining an equal ability and taste for books, company, and business; preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letters; and in business, that probity and accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy.\n\nIn the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, genius is the ability to independently arrive at and understand concepts that would normally have to be taught by another person. For Kant, originality was the essential character of genius. This genius is a talent for producing ideas which can be described as non-imitative. Kant's discussion of the characteristics of genius is largely contained within the \"Critique of Judgment\" and was well received by the Romantics of the early 19th century. In addition, much of Schopenhauer's theory of genius, particularly regarding talent and freedom from constraint, is directly derived from paragraphs of Part I of Kant's \"Critique of Judgment\".\n\nIn the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, a genius is someone in whom intellect predominates over \"will\" much more than within the average person. In Schopenhauer's aesthetics, this predominance of the intellect over the will allows the genius to create artistic or academic works that are objects of pure, disinterested contemplation, the chief criterion of the aesthetic experience for Schopenhauer. Their remoteness from mundane concerns means that Schopenhauer's geniuses often display maladaptive traits in more mundane concerns; in Schopenhauer's words, they fall into the mire while gazing at the stars, an allusion to Plato's dialogue \"TheÃ¦tetus\", in which Socrates tells of Thales (the first philosopher) being ridiculed for falling in such circumstances. As he says in Volume 2 of \"The World as Will and Representation\":\n\nIn the philosophy of Bertrand Russell, genius entails that an individual possesses unique qualities and talents that make the genius especially valuable to the society in which he or she operates, once given the chance to contribute to society. Russell's philosophy further maintains, however, that it is possible for such geniuses to be crushed in their youth and lost forever when the environment around them is unsympathetic to their potential maladaptive traits. Russell rejected the notion he believed was popular during his lifetime that, \"genius will out\".\n\n\nSources listed in chronological order of publication within each category.\n\n\n\n", "id": "12432", "title": "Genius"}
